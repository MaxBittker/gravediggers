"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tR. L. StevensonNow there is nothing wrong with meExcept -- I think it's called T.B.And that is why I have to layOut in the garden all the day.Our garden is not very wideAnd cars go by on either side,And make an angry-hooty noiseThat rather startles little boys.But worst of all is when they takeMe out in cars that growl and shake,With charabancs so dreadful-nearI have to shut my eyes for fear.But when I'm on my back again,I watch the Croydon aeroplaneThat flies across to France, and singsLike hitting thick piano-strings.When I am strong enough to doThe things I'm truly wishful to,I'll never use a car or trainBut always have an aeroplane;And just go zooming round and round,And frighten Nursey with the sound,And see the angel-side of clouds,And spit on all those motor-crowds!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tO Rose! who dares to name thee?No longer roseate now, nor soft, nor sweet;But pale, and hard, and dry, as stubble-wheat,---     Kept seven years in a drawer---thy titles shame thee.     The breeze that used to blow theeBetween the hedgerow thorns, and take awayAn odour up the lane to last all day,---     If breathing now,---unsweetened would forego thee.     The sun that used to smite thee,And mix his glory in thy gorgeous urn,Till beam appeared to bloom, and flower to burn,---     If shining now,---with not a hue would light thee.     The dew that used to wet thee,And, white first, grow incarnadined, becauseIt lay upon thee where the crimson was,---     If dropping now,---would darken where it met thee.     The fly that lit upon thee,To stretch the tendrils of its tiny feet,Along thy leaf's pure edges, after heat,---     If lighting now,---would coldly overrun thee.     The bee that once did suck thee,And build thy perfumed ambers up his hive,And swoon in thee for joy, till scarce alive,---     If passing now,---would blindly overlook thee.     The heart doth recognise thee,Alone, alone! The heart doth smell thee sweet,Doth view thee fair, doth judge thee most complete,---     Though seeing now those changes that disguise thee.     Yes, and the heart doth owe theeMore love, dead rose! than to such roses boldAs Julia wears at dances, smiling cold!---     Lie still upon this heart---which breaks below thee!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy tears are like the quiet driftOf petals from some magic rose;And all my grief flows from the riftOf unremembered skies and snows.I think, that if I touched the earth,It would crumble;It is so sad and beautiful,So tremulously like a dream.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I was young, I used toWatch behind the curtainsAs men walked up and down the street. Wino men, old men.Young men sharp as mustard.See them. Men are alwaysGoing somewhere.They knew I was there. FifteenYears old and starving for them.Under my window, they would pauses,Their shoulders high like theBreasts of a young girl,Jacket tails slapping overThose behinds,Men.One day they hold you in thePalms of their hands, gentle, as if youWere the last raw egg in the world. ThenThey tighten up. Just a little. TheFirst squeeze is nice. A quick hug.Soft into your defenselessness. A littleMore. The hurt begins. Wrench out aSmile that slides around the fear. When theAir disappears,Your mind pops, exploding fiercely, briefly,Like the head of a kitchen match. Shattered.It is your juiceThat runs down their legs. Staining their shoes.When the earth rights itself again,And taste tries to return to the tongue,Your body has slammed shut. Forever.No keys exist.Then the window draws full uponYour mind. There, just beyondThe sway of curtains, men walk.Knowing something.Going someplace.But this time, I will simplyStand and watch.Maybe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a change--and I am poor;Your love hath been, nor long ago,A fountain at my fond heart's door,Whose only business was to flow;And flow it did; not taking heedOf its own bounty, or my need.What happy moments did I count!Blest was I then all bliss above!Now, for that consecrated fountOf murmuring, sparkling, living love,What have I? Shall I dare to tell?A comfortless and hidden well.A well of love--it may be deep--I trust it is,--and never dry:What matter? If the waters sleepIn silence and obscurity.--Such change, and at the very doorOf my fond heart, hath made me poor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow Let's look for birds! The tall iron branches in the forest, The dense fertility on the ground. The world is wet. A dewdrop or raindrop shines, a diminutive star among the leaves. The morning time mother earth is cool. The air is like a river which shakes the silence. It smells of rosemary, of space and roots. Overhead, a crazy song. It's a bird. How out of its throat smaller than a finger can there fall the waters of its song? Luminous ease! Invisible power torrent of music in the leaves. Sacred conversations! Clean and fresh washed is this day resounding like a green dulcimer. I bury my shoes in the mud, jump over rivulets. A thorn bites me and a gust of air like a crystal wave splits up inside my chest. Where are the birds? Maybe it was that rustling in the foliage or that fleeting pellet of brown velvet or that displaced perfume? That leaf that let loose cinnamon smell - was that a bird? That dust from an irritated magnolia or that fruit which fell with a thump - was that a flight? Oh, invisible little critters birds of the devil with their ringing with their useless feathers. I only want to caress them, to see them resplendent. I don't want to see under glass the embalmed lightning. I want to see them living. I want to touch their gloves of real hide, which they never forget in the branches and to converse with them sitting on my shoulders although they may leave me like certain statues undeservedly whitewashed. Impossible. You can't touch them. You can hear them like a heavenly rustle or movement. They converse with precision. They repeat their observations. They brag of how much they do. They comment on everything that exists. They learn certain sciences like hydrography. and by a sure science they know where there are harvests of grain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I go up through the mowing field,The headless aftermath,Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,Half closes the garden path.And when I come to the garden ground,The whir of sober birdsUp from the tangle of withered weedsIs sadder than any wordsA tree beside the wall stands bare,But a leaf that lingered brown,Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,Comes softly rattling down.I end not far from my going forthBy picking the faded blueOf the last remaining aster flowerTo carry again to you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe eyeless labourer in the night,the selfless, shapeless seed I hold,builds for its resurrection day---silent and swift and deep from sightforesees the unimagined light.This is no child with a child's face;this has no name to name it by;yet you and I have known it well.This is our hunter and our chase,the third who lay in our embrace.This is the strength that your arm knows,the arc of flesh that is my breast,the precise crystals of our eyes.This is the blood's wild tree that growsthe intricate and folded rose.This is the maker and the made;this is the question and reply;the blind head butting at the dark,the blaze of light along the blade.Oh hold me, for I am afraid.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe calm, Cool face of the riverAsked me for a kiss.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere's a place called Far-away MeadowWe never shall mow in again,Or such is the talk at the farmhouse:The meadow is finished with men.Then now is the chance for the flowersThat can't stand mowers and plowers.It must be now, through, in seasonBefore the not mowing brings trees on,Before trees, seeing the opening,March into a shadowy claim.The trees are all I'm afraid of,That flowers can't bloom in the shade of;It's no more men I'm afraid of;The meadow is done with the tame.The place for the moment is oursFor you, oh tumultuous flowers,To go to waste and go wild in,All shapes and colors of flowers,I needn't call you by name.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?And the tedding and the spreadingOf the straw for a bedding,And the fleas that tease in the High Pyrenees,And the wine that tasted of tar?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers(Under the vine of the dark veranda)?Do you remember an Inn, Miranda,Do you remember an Inn?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteersWho hadn't got a penny,And who weren't paying any,And the hammer at the doors and the din?And the hip! hop! hap!Of the clapOf the hands to the swirl and the twirlOf the girl gone chancing,Glancing,Dancing,Backing and advancing,Snapping of the clapper to the spinOut and in--And the ting, tong, tang of the guitar!Do you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?Never more;Miranda,Never more.Only the high peaks hoar;And Aragon a torrent at the door.No soundIn the walls of the halls where fallsThe treadOf the feet of the dead to the ground,No sound:But the boomOf the far waterfall like doom.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy friends all know that I am shy,But the chipmunk is twice and shy and I.He moves with flickering indecisionLike stripes across the television.He's like the shadow of a cloud,Or Emily Dickinson read aloud.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe wear the mask that grins and lies,It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--This debt we pay to human guile;With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be overwise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, whileWe wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our criesTo thee from tortured souls arise.We sing, but oh the clay is vileBeneath our feet, and long the mile;But let the world dream otherwise,We wear the mask!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am: yet what I am none cares or knows,My friends forsake me like a memory lost;I am the self-consumer of my woes,They rise and vanish in oblivious host,Like shades in love and death's oblivion lost;And yet I am! and live with shadows tostInto the nothingness of scorn and noise,Into the living sea of waking dreams,Where there is neither sense of life nor joys,But the vast shipwreck of my life's esteems;And e'en the dearest--that I loved the best--Are strange--nay, rather stranger than the rest.I long for scenes where man has never trod;A place where woman never smil'd or wept;There to abide with my creator, God,And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept:Untroubling and untroubled where I lie;The grass below--above the vaulted sky.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, The road is forlorn all day, Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, And the hoof-prints vanish away. The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,Expend their bloom in vain. Come over the hills and far with me, And be my love in the rain. The birds have less to say for themselves In the wood-world’s torn despairThan now these numberless years the elves, Although they are no less there: All song of the woods is crushed like some Wild, easily shattered rose. Come, be my love in the wet woods; come,Where the boughs rain when it blows. There is the gale to urge behind And bruit our singing down, And the shallow waters aflutter with wind From which to gather your gown.What matter if we go clear to the west, And come not through dry-shod? For wilding brooch shall wet your breast The rain-fresh goldenrod. Oh, never this whelming east wind swellsBut it seems like the sea’s return To the ancient lands where it left the shells Before the age of the fern; And it seems like the time when after doubt Our love came back amain.Oh, come forth into the storm and rout And be my love in the rain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe low lands callI am tempted to answerThey are offering me a free dwelling Without having to conquerThe massive mountain makes its moveBeckoning me to ascendA much more difficult pathTo get up the slippery bendI cannot choose both I have a choice to makeI must be wiseThis will determine my fateI choose, I choose the mountainWith all its stress and strainBecause only by climbingCan I rise above the plainI choose the  mountain And I will never stop climbingI choose the mountainAnd I shall forever be ascendingI choose the mountain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is society, where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar: I love not man the less, but Nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal From all I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the Universe, and feel What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I think about myself, I almost laugh myself to death, My life has been one great big joke, A dance that's walked A song that's spoke, I laugh so hard I almost choke When I think about myself.Sixty years in these folks' world The child I works for calls me girl I say 'Yes ma'am' for working's sake. Too proud to bend Too poor to break, I laugh until my stomach ache, When I think about myself.My folks can make me split my side, I laughed so hard I nearly died, The tales they tell, sound just like lying, They grow the fruit, But eat the rind, I laugh until I start to crying, When I think about my folks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember rain falls on the house.In the failing light, the old grandmothersits in the kitchen with the childbeside the Little Marvel Stove,reading the jokes from the almanac,laughing and talking to hide her tears.She thinks that her equinoctial tearsand the rain that beats on the roof of the house were both foretold by the almanac,but only known to a grandmother.The iron kettle sings on the stove.She cuts some bread and says to the child,It's time for tea now; but the childis watching the teakettle's small hard tearsdance like mad on the hot black stove,the way the rain must dance on the house.Tidying up, the old grandmotherhangs up the clever almanacon its string. Birdlike, the almanachovers half open above the child,hovers above the old grandmotherand her teacup full of dark brown tears.She shivers and says she thinks the housefeels chilly, and puts more wood in the stove.It was to be, says the Marvel Stove.I know what I know, says the almanac.With crayons the child draws a rigid houseand a winding pathway. Then the childputs in a man with buttons like tearsand shows it proudly to the grandmother.But secretly, while the grandmotherbusies herself about the stove,the little moons fall down like tearsfrom between the pages of the almanacinto the flower bed the childhas carefully placed in the front of the house.Time to plant tears, says the almanac.The grandmother sings to the marvelous stoveand the child draws another inscrutable house.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe coconuts have got the jobs.The race industry is a growth industry.We despairing, they careering.We want more peace they want more police.The Uncle Toms are getting paid.The race industry is a growth industry.We say sisters and brothers don't fear.They will do anything for the Mayor.The coconuts have got the jobs.The race industry is a growth industry.They're looking for victims and poets to rent.They represent me without my consent.The Uncle Toms are getting paid.The race industry is a growth industry.In suits they dither in fear of anarchy.They take our sufferings and earn a salary.Steal our souls and make their documentaries.Inform daily on our community.Without Black suffering they'd have no jobs.Without our dead they'd have no office.Without our tears they'd have no drink.If they stopped sucking we could get justice. The coconuts are getting paid.Men, women and Brixton are being betrayed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlas! they had been friends in youth;But whispering tongues can poison truth;And constancy lives in realms above;And life is thorny; and youth is vain;And to be wroth with one we love,Doth work like madness in the brain.And thus is chanced, as I divine,With Roland and Sir Leoline.Each spake words of high disdainAnd insult to his heart's best brother:They parted - ne'er to meet again!But never either found anotherTo free the hollow heart from painting -They stood aloof, the scars remaining,Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;A dreary see now flows between; -But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunderShall wholly do away, I ween,The marks of that which once hath been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNegroes,Sweet and docile,Meek, humble and kind:Beware the dayThey change their mind!WindIn the cotton fields,Gentle Breeze:Beware the hourIt uproots trees!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo you think its Stephen?Then I'd best make sureBe on the safe side as it were.Ah, theres been a mistake.

It was by having been contrastedThat good and bad so long had lasted.That's why discrimination reigns.That's why we need a lot of brainsIf only to discriminate 'Twixt what to love and what to hate.To quote the oracle at Delphi, Love thy neighbor as thyself, aye, And hate him as thyself thou hatest.There quandary is at its greatest.We learned from the forbidden fruitFor brains there is no substitute.'Unless it's sweetbreads, ' you suggestWith innuendo I detest.You drive me to confess in ink: Once I was fool enough to thinkThat brains and sweetbreads were the same, Till I was caught and put to shame, First by a butcher, then a cook, Then by a scientific book.But ' twas by making sweetbreads doI passed with such a high I.Q.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than halfway up the passWas a spring with a broken drinking glass,And whether the farmer drank or notHis mare was sure to observe the spotBy cramping the wheel on a water-bar,turning her forehead with a star,And straining her ribs for a monster sigh;To which the farmer would make reply,'A sigh for every so many breath,And for every so many sigh a death.That's what I always tell my wifeIs the multiplication table of life.'The saying may be ever so true;But it's just the kind of a thing that youNor I, nor nobody else may say,Unless our purpose is doing harm,And then I know of no better wayTo close a road, abandon a farm,Reduce the births of the human race,And bring back nature in people's place.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFishermen at BallyshannonNetted an infant last nightAlong with the salmon.An illegitimate spawning,A small one thrown backTo the waters. But I'm sureAs she stood in the shallowsDucking him tenderlyTill the frozen knobs of her wristsWere dead as the gravel,He was a minnow with hooksTearing her open.She waded in underThe sign of the cross.He was hauled in with the fish.Now limbo will beA cold glitter of soulsThrough some far briny zone.Even Christ's palms, unhealed,Smart and cannot fish there.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSea waves are green and wet,But up from where they die,Rise others vaster yet,And those are brown and dry.They are the sea made landTo come at the fisher town,And bury in solid sandThe men she could not drown.She may know cove and cape,But she does not know mankindIf by any change of shape,She hopes to cut off mind.Men left her a ship to sink:They can leave her a hut as well;And be but more free to thinkFor the one more cast-off shell.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce there was a tree....and she loved a little boy.And everyday the boy would comeand he would gather her leavesand make them into crownsand play king of the forest.He would climb up her trunkand swing from her branchesand eat apples.And they would play hide-and-go-seek.And when he was tired,he would sleep in her shade.And the boy loved the tree....very much.And the tree was happy.But time went by.And the boy grew older.And the tree was often alone.Then one day the boy came to the treeand the tree said, 'Come, Boy, come andclimb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in myshade and be happy.''I am too big to climb and play' saidthe boy.'I want to buy things and have fun.I want some money?''I'm sorry,' said the tree, 'but Ihave no money.I have only leaves and apples.Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city. Then you will have money andyou will be happy.'And so the boy climbed up thetree and gathered her applesand carried them away.And the tree was happy.But the boy stayed away for a long time....and the tree was sad.And then one day the boy came backand the tree shook with joyand she said, 'Come, Boy, climb up my trunkand swing from my branches and be happy.''I am too busy to climb trees,' said the boy.'I want a house to keep me warm,' he said.'I want a wife and I want children,and so I need a house.Can you give me a house ?' ' I have no house,' said the tree.'The forest is my house,but you may cut off my branches and build a house. Then you will be happy.'And so the boy cut off her branchesand carried them awayto build his house.And the tree was happy.But the boy stayed away for a long time.And when he came back,the tree was so happyshe could hardly speak.'Come, Boy,' she whispered,'come and play.''I am too old and sad to play,'said the boy.'I want a boat that will take me far away from here.Can you give me a boat?''Cut down my trunkand make a boat,' said the tree.'Then you can sail away...and be happy.'And so the boy cut down her trunkand made a boat and sailed away.And the tree was happy... but not really.And after a long timethe boy came back again.'I am sorry, Boy,'said the tree,' but I have nothingleft to give you -My apples are gone.''My teeth are too weakfor apples,' said the boy.'My branches are gone,'said the tree. ' Youcannot swing on them - ''I am too old to swingon branches,' said the boy.'My trunk is gone, ' said the tree.'You cannot climb - ''I am too tired to climb' said the boy.'I am sorry,' sighed the tree.'I wish that I could give you something....but I have nothing left. I am just an old stump.I am sorry....''I don't need very much now,' said the boy.'just a quiet place to sit and rest.I am very tired.''Well,' said the tree, straighteningherself up as much as she could,'well, an old stump is good for sitting and restingCome, Boy, sit down.

A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The restClung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast; They thought, 'If only Casey could but get a whack at that- We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.' But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake; So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball; And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third. Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell; It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell; It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat. There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place; There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat. Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt; Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt; Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip. And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped- 'That ain't my style,' said Casey. 'Strike one! ' the umpire said. From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore; 'Kill him! Kill the umpire! ' shouted some one on the stand; And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand. With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone; He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on; He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew; But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, 'Strike two! ' 'Fraud! ' cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered 'Fraud! 'But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again. The sneer has fled from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate; He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go.And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow. Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright; The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,And somewhere men are laughing, and little children shout; But there is no joy in Mudville- mighty Casey has struck out.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHeLift up the veils that darken the delicate moon of thy glory and grace,Withhold not, O love, from the night of my longing the joy of thy luminous face,Give me a spear of the scented keora guarding thy pinioned curls, Or a silken thread from the fringes that trouble the dream of thy glimmering pearls;Faint grows my soul with thy tresses' perfume and the song of thy anklets' caprice,Revive me, I pray, with the magical nectar that dwells in the flower of thy kiss.She How shall I yield to the voice of thy pleading, how shall I grant thy prayer,Or give thee a rose-red silken tassel, a scented leaf from my hair?Or fling in the flame of thy heart's desire the veils that cover my face,Profane the law of my father's creed for a foe of my father's race?Thy kinsmen have broken our sacred altars and slaughtered our sacred kine,The feud of old faiths and the blood of old battles sever thy people and mine.HeWhat are the sins of my race, Beloved, what are my people to thee? And what are thy shrines, and kine and kindred, what are thy gods to me?Love recks not of feuds and bitter follies, of stranger, comrade or kin,Alike in his ear sound the temple bells and the cry of the muezzin.For Love shall cancel the ancient wrong and conquer the ancient rage,Redeem with his tears the memoried sorrow that sullied a bygone age.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlas!

II I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. III The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. It was a small part of the pantomime. IV A man and a woman Are one. A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. V I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. VI Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. VII O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? VIII I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms; But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. IX When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. X At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. XI He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. XII The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying. XIII It was evening all afternoon. It was snowing And it was going to snow. The blackbird sat In the cedar-limbs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was a long time ago.I have almost forgotten my dream.But it was there then,In front of me,Bright like a sun—My dream.And then the wall rose,Rose slowly,Slowly,Between me and my dream.Rose until it touched the sky—The wall.Shadow.I am black.I lie down in the shadow.No longer the light of my dream before me,Above me.Only the thick wall.Only the shadow.My hands! My dark hands! Break through the wall! Find my dream! Help me to shatter this darkness,To smash this night,To break this shadowInto a thousand lights of sun,Into a thousand whirling dreamsOf sun!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEnobarbus describes Queen CleopatraEnobarbus: I will tell you.The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,Burned on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails, and so perfumed thatThe winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,It beggar'd all description: she did lieIn her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,O'erpicturing that Venus where we seeThe fancy outwork nature: on each side herStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seemTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,And what they undid did.Agrippa: O, rare for Antony.Enobarbus: Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,And made their bends adornings. At the helmA seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackleSwell with the touches of those flower-soft handsThat yarely frame the office. From the bargeA strange invisible perfume hits the senseOf the adjacent wharfs. The city castHer people out upon her; and Antony,Enthroned i' th' marketplace, did sit alone,Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,And made a gap in nature.Agrippa: Rare Egyptian!Enobarbus: Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,Invited her to supper. She repliedIt should be better he became her guest;Which she entreated. Our courteous Antony,Whom ne'er the word of \"No\" woman heard speak,Being barbered ten times o'er, goes to the feast,And for his ordinary, pays his heartFor what his eyes eat only.Agrippa: Royal wench!She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;He plowed her, and she cropped.Enobarbus: I saw her onceHop forty paces through the public street;And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,That she did make defect perfection,And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.Maecenas: Now Antony must leave her utterly.Enobarbus: Never; He will not:Age cannot wither her, nor custom staleHer infinite variety. Other women cloyThe appetites they feed, but she makes hungryWhere most she satisfies; for vilest thingsBecome themselves in her, that the holy priestsBless her when she is riggish.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou have to be always drunk. That's all there is to it--it's the only way. So as not to feel the horrible burden of time that breaks your back and bends you to the earth, you have to be continually drunk. But on what?Wine, poetry or virtue, as you wish. But be drunk. And if sometimes, on the steps of a palace or the green grass of a ditch, in the mournful solitude of your room, you wake again, drunkenness already diminishing or gone, ask the wind, the wave, the star, the bird, the clock, everything that is flying, everything that is groaning, everything that is rolling, everything that is singing, everything that is speaking. . .ask what time it is and wind, wave, star, bird, clock will answer you:\"It is time to be drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of time, be drunk, becontinually drunk! On wine, on poetry or on virtue as you wish.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t129Cocoon above!

It got darkearly. The waiting roomwas full of grown-up people,arctics and overcoats,lamps and magazines.My aunt was insidewhat seemed like a long timeand while I waited and readthe National Geographic(I could read) and carefullystudied the photographs:the inside of a volcano,black, and full of ashes;then it was spilling overin rivulets of fire.Osa and Martin Johnsondressed in riding breeches,laced boots, and pith helmets.A dead man slung on a pole\"Long Pig,\" the caption said.Babies with pointed headswound round and round with string;black, naked women with neckswound round and round with wirelike the necks of light bulbs.Their breasts were horrifying.I read it right straight through.I was too shy to stop.And then I looked at the cover:the yellow margins, the date.Suddenly, from inside,came an oh! of pain--Aunt Consuelo's voice--not very loud or long.I wasn't at all surprised;even then I knew she wasa foolish, timid woman.I might have been embarrassed,but wasn't. What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it was me:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I--we--were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof the National Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you'll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are an I,you are an Elizabeth,you are one of them.Why should you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance--I couldn't look any higher--at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similaritiesboots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventhe National Geographicand those awful hanging breastsheld us all togetheror made us all just one?How I didn't know anyword for it how \"unlikely\". . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn't?The waiting room was brightand too hot. It was slidingbeneath a big black wave,another, and another.Then I was back in it.The War was on. Outside,in Worcester, Massachusetts,were night and slush and cold,and it was still the fifthof February, 1918.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't go far off, not even for a day, because -- because -- I don't know how to say it: a day is long and I will be waiting for you, as in an empty station when the trains are parked off somewhere else, asleep. Don't leave me, even for an hour, because then the little drops of anguish will all run together, the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift into me, choking my lost heart. Oh, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach; may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance. Don't leave me for a second, my dearest, because in that moment you'll have gone so far I'll wander mazily over all the earth, asking, Will you come back? Will you leave me here, dying?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo the one I love, the one I adore, My only goal in life, the one I live for -Though we might fight more than we get along, I hope our relationship will never go wrong.I love to be with you, I love you around; I'm so glad I'm the one you found.Though you may not see what you mean to me, My love for you will always be.I know you love me and I know you care; That's why I treasure the love we share.I want you to know I'm here for you, Whatever it is I'll help you through.To the one I love, the one I adore, My love grows every day more and more.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI never saw a moor;I never saw the sea,Yet know I how the heather looksAnd what a billow be.I never spoke with God,Nor visited in heaven.Yet certain am I of the spotAs if the checks were given.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tO, to have a little house! To own the hearth and stool and all! The heaped up sods against the fire, The pile of turf against the wall! To have a clock with weights and chains And pendulum swinging up and down! A dresser filled with shining delph, Speckled and white and blue and brown! I could be busy all the day Clearing and sweeping hearth and floor, And fixing on their shelf again My white and blue and speckled store! I could be quiet there at night Beside the fire and by myself, Sure of a bed and loth to leave The ticking clock and the shining delph! Och! but I'm weary of mist and dark, And roads where there's never a house nor bush, And tired I am of bog and road, And the crying wind and the lonesome hush! And I am praying to God on high, And I am praying Him night and day, For a little house - a house of my own Out of the wind's and the rain's way.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow doth the little crocodileImprove his shining tail,And pour the waters of the NileOn every golden scale! How cheerfully he seems to grinHow neatly spreads his claws,And welcomes little fishes in,With gently smiling jaws!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI, too, saw God through mud-- The mud that cracked on cheeks when wretches smiled. War brought more glory to their eyes than blood, And gave their laughs more glee than shakes a child. Merry it was to laugh there-- Where death becomes absurd and life absurder. For power was on us as we slashed bones bare Not to feel sickness or remorse of murder. I, too, have dropped off fear-- Behind the barrage, dead as my platoon, And sailed my spirit surging, light and clear, Past the entanglement where hopes lie strewn; And witnessed exhultation-- Faces that used to curse me, scowl for scowl, Shine and lift up with passion of oblation, Seraphic for an hour, though they were foul. I have made fellowships-- Untold of happy lovers in old song. For love is not the binding of fair lips With the soft silk of eyes that look and long. By joy, whose ribbon slips,-- But wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong; Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips; Knit in the welding of the rifle-thong. I have perceived much beauty In the hoarse oaths that kept our courage straight; Heard music in the silentness of duty; Found peace where shell-storms spouted reddest spate. Nevertheless, except you share With them in hell the sorrowful dark of hell, Whose world is but a trembling of a flare And heaven but a highway for a shell, You shall not hear their mirth: You shall not come to think them well content By any jest of mine. These men are worth Your tears: You are not worth their merriment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt smelt of new rains and of tenderShoots of plants- and its warmth was the warmthOf earth groping for roots… even mySoul, I thought, must send its roots somewhereAnd, I loved his body without shame,On winter evenings as cold windsChuckled against the white window-panes.[From Summer in Calcutta]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDo not stand at my grave and weep  I am not there. I do not sleep.  I am a thousand winds that blow.  I am the diamond glints on snow.  I am the sunlight on ripened grain.  I am the gentle autumn rain.  When you awaken in the morning's hush  I am the swift uplifting rush  Of quiet birds in circled flight.  I am the soft stars that shine at night.  Do not stand at my grave and cry;  I am not there. I did not die.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe happiest day- the happiest hour        My sear'd and blighted heart hath known,      The highest hope of pride and power,        I feel hath flown.      Of power! said I? yes! such I ween;        But they have vanish'd long, alas!      The visions of my youth have been-        But let them pass.      And, pride, what have I now with thee?        Another brow may even inherit      The venom thou hast pour'd on me        Be still, my spirit!      The happiest day- the happiest hour        Mine eyes shall see- have ever seen,      The brightest glance of pride and power,        I feel- have been:      But were that hope of pride and power        Now offer'd with the pain      Even then I felt- that brightest hour        I would not live again:      For on its wing was dark alloy,        And, as it flutter'd- fell      An essence- powerful to destroy        A soul that knew it well.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOh, but it is dirty!--this little filling station,oil-soaked, oil-permeatedto a disturbing, over-allblack translucency.Be careful with that match!Father wears a dirty,oil-soaked monkey suitthat cuts him under the arms,and several quick and saucyand greasy sons assist him(it's a family filling station),all quite thoroughly dirty.Do they live in the station?It has a cement porchbehind the pumps, and on ita set of crushed and grease-impregnated wickerwork;on the wicker sofaa dirty dog, quite comfy.Some comic books providethe only note of color--of certain color.

Whole families shopping at night! Aislesfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! --- and you,Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among themeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What pricebananas? Are you my Angel?I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, andfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tastingartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way doesyour beard point tonight?(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feelabsurd.)Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade toshade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles indriveways, home to our silent cottage?Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did youhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank andstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere had I heard this wind beforeChange like this to a deeper roar? What would it take my standing there for,Holding open a restive door,Looking down hill to a frothy shore? Summer was past and the day was past.Sombre clouds in the west were massed.Out on the porch's sagging floor,Leaves got up in a coil and hissed,Blindly struck at my knee and missed.Something sinister in the toneTold me my secret must be known:Word I was in the house aloneSomehow must have gotten abroad,Word I was in my life alone,Word I had no one left but God.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIO wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves deadAre driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,Who chariotest to their dark wintry bedThe winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,Each like a corpse within its grave, untilThine azure sister of the Spring shall blowHer clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)With living hues and odors plain and hill:Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh, hear!IIThou on whose stream, 'mid the steep sky's commotion,Loose clouds like earth's decaying leaves are shed,Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean,Angels of rain and lightning: there are spreadOn the blue surface of thine aery surge,Like the bright hair uplifted from the headOf some fierce Maenad, even from the dim vergeOf the horizon to the zenith's height,The locks of the approaching storm. Thou dirgeOf the dying year, to which this closing nightWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,Vaulted with all thy congregated mightOf vapors, from whose solid atmosphereBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh, hear!IIIThou who didst waken from his summer dreamsThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,And saw in sleep old palaces and towersQuivering within the wave's intenser day,All overgrown with azure moss and flowersSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! ThouFor whose path the Atlantic's level powersCleave themselves into chasms, while far belowThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wearThe sapless foliage of the ocean, knowThy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,And tremble and despoil themselves: oh, hear!IVIf I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;A wave to pant beneath thy power, and shareThe impulse of thy strength, only less freeThan thou, O uncontrollable! If evenI were as in my boyhood, and could beThe comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speedScarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have strivenAs thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowedOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.VMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:What if my leaves are falling like its own!The tumult of thy mighty harmoniesWill take from both a deep, autumnal tone,Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!Drive my dead thoughts over the universeLike withered leaves to quicken a new birth!And, by the incantation of this verse,Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearthAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!Be through my lips to unawakened earthThe trumpet of a prophecy! O Wind,If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power,---that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity. But I find that thy will knows no end in me.

We took our chanst among the Khyber 'ills,  The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills,  An' a Zulu ~impi~ dished us up in style:But all we ever got from such as they  Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller;We 'eld our bloomin' own, the papers say,  But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us 'oller.    Then 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' the missis and the kid;    Our orders was to break you, an' of course we went an' did.    We sloshed you with Martinis, an' it wasn't 'ardly fair;    But for all the odds agin' you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square.

II I was of three minds, Like a tree In which there are three blackbirds. III The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. It was a small part of the pantomime. IV A man and a woman Are one. A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. V I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. VI Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. VII O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? VIII I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms; But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. IX When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. X At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. XI He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. XII The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying. XIII It was evening all afternoon. It was snowing And it was going to snow. The blackbird sat In the cedar-limbs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn time of silver rainThe earth puts forth new life again,Green grasses growAnd flowers lift their heads,And over all the plainThe wonder spreadsOf Life,Of Life,Of life!In time of silver rainThe butterflies lift silken wingsTo catch a rainbow cry,And trees put forth new leaves to singIn joy beneath the skyAs down the roadwayPassing boys and girlsGo singing, too,In time of silver rain When springAnd lifeAre new.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe who binds to himself a joyDoes the winged life destroy; But he who kisses the joy as it fliesLives in eternity's sun rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo whoever is not listening to the seathis Friday morning, to whoever is cooped upin house or office, factory or womanor street or mine or harsh prison cell;to him I come, and, without speaking or looking,I arrive and open the door of his prison,and a vibration starts up, vague and insistent,a great fragment of thunder sets in motionthe rumble of the planet and the foam,the raucous rivers of the ocean flood,the star vibrates swiftly in its corona,and the sea is beating, dying and continuing.So, drawn on by my destiny,I ceaselessly must listen to and keepthe sea's lamenting in my awareness,I must feel the crash of the hard waterand gather it up in a perpetual cupso that, wherever those in prison may be,wherever they suffer the autumn's castigation,I may be there with an errant wave,I may move, passing through windows,and hearing me, eyes will glance upwardsaying 'How can I reach the sea?'And I shall broadcast, saying nothing,the starry echoes of the wave,a breaking up of foam and quicksand,a rustling of salt withdrawing,the grey cry of the sea-birds on the coast.So, through me, freedom and the seawill make their answer to the shuttered heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am standing upon the seashore. A ship, at my side,spreads her white sails to the moving breeze and startsfor the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength.I stand and watch her until, at length, she hangs like a speckof white cloud just where the sea and sky come to mingle with each other.Then, someone at my side says, 'There, she is gone'Gone where?Gone from my sight. That is all. She is just as large in mast,hull and spar as she was when she left my side.And, she is just as able to bear her load of living freight to her destined port.Her diminished size is in me -  not in her.And, just at the moment when someone says, 'There, she is gone,'there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voicesready to take up the glad shout, 'Here she comes!'And that is dying...Death comes in its own time, in its own way.Death is as unique as the individual experiencing it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder the wide and starry skyDig the grave and let me lie.Glad did I live and gladly die,And I laid me down with a will.This be the verse you grave for me;\"Here he lies where he longed to be,Home is the sailor, home from sea,And the hunter home from the hill.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBent double, like old beggars under sacks,Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge,Till on the haunting flares we turned out backs,And towards our distant rest began to trudge.Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots,But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame, all blind; Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hootsOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumblingFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,But someone still was yelling out and stumblingAnd flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.- Dim through the misty panes and thick green light,As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.In all my dreams before my helpless sightHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.If in some smothering dreams, you too could paceBehind the wagon that we flung him in,And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin,If you could hear, at every jolt, the bloodCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungsObscene as cancer, bitter as the cudOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,- My friend, you would not tell with such high zestTo children ardent for some desperate glory,The old Lie: Dulce et decorum estPro patria mori.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tToday I pass the time readinga favorite haiku,saying the few words over and over.It feels like eatingthe same small, perfect grapeagain and again.I walk through the house reciting itand leave its letters fallingthrough the air of every room.I stand by the big silence of the piano and say it.I say it in front of a painting of the sea.I tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf.I listen to myself saying it,then I say it without listening,then I hear it without saying it.And when the dog looks up at me,I kneel down on the floorand whisper it into each of his long white ears.It's the one about the one-ton temple bellwith the moth sleeping on its surface,and every time I say it, I feel the excruciatingpressure of the mothon the surface of the iron bell.When I say it at the window,the bell is the worldand I am the moth resting there.When I say it at the mirror,I am the heavy belland the moth is life with its papery wings.And later, when I say it to you in the dark,you are the bell,and I am the tongue of the bell, ringing you,and the moth has flownfrom its lineand moves like a hinge in the air above our bed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this book,And slowly read, and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true,But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overheadAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; And give us not to think so far away As the uncertain harvest; keep us here All simply in the springing of the year. Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; And make us happy in the happy bees, The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. And make us happy in the darting bird That suddenly above the bees is heard,The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill, And off a blossom in mid air stands still. For this is love and nothing else is love, The which it is reserved for God above To sanctify to what far ends He will,But which it only needs that we fulfil.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo keep your marriage brimmingWith love in the loving cup,Whenever you’re wrong, admit it; Whenever you’re right, shut up.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie trackI go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minuteAnd look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it. I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.I know this house isn't haunted, and I wish it were, I do;For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two. This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside. If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paidI'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.I'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to beAnd I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free. Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.But there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and loneFor the lack of something within it that it has never known. But a house that has done what a house should do,  a house that has sheltered life,That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet. So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie trackI never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe are always askedto understand the other person'sviewpointno matter howout-datedfoolish orobnoxious.one is askedto viewtheir total errortheir life-wastewithkindliness,especially if they areaged.but age is the total ofour doing.they have agedbadlybecause they havelivedout of focus,they have refused tosee.not their fault?whose fault?mine?I am asked to hidemy viewpointfrom themfor fear of theirfear.age is no crimebut the shameof a deliberatelywastedlifeamong so manydeliberatelywastedlivesis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor to have survived European colonization for them worth a boastTo the first Australians we should drink a toastAnthropologists claim their ancestors reached the southern shores sixty thousand years agoAnd maybe even further back in time for of that how would they knowCaptain Cook's arrival brought them no joy but tearsIn twenty with two centuries of yearsThey are pushed to extinction's brink by the colonizing raceAnd in their own Country demoted to a minor placeFor two hundred and twenty years racism they have knownAnd respect to them it never has been shownTreated as second class citizens in their own HomelandThat does seem rather hard to understandThe first Australians their praises we should singAs a race they have survived and that is an amazing thing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s good to feel you are close to me in the night, love,invisible in your sleep, intently nocturnal,while I untangle my worriesas if they were twisted nets.Withdrawn, your heart sails through dream,but your body, relinquished so, breathesseeking me without seeing me perfecting my dreamlike a plant that seeds itself in the dark.Rising, you will be that other, alive in the dawn,but from the frontiers lost in the night,from the presence and the absence where we meet ourselves,something remains, drawing us into the light of lifeas if the sign of the shadows had sealedits secret creatures with flame.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was an Old Man in a tree,Who was horribly bored by a bee.When they said \"Does it buzz?\"He replied \"Yes, it does!It's a regular brute of a bee!\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce upon a time a frogCroaked away in Bingle BogEvery night from dusk to dawnHe croaked awn and awn and awnOther creatures loathed his voice,But, alas, they had no choice,And the crass cacophonyBlared out from the sumac treeAt whose foot the frog each nightMinstrelled on till morning nightNeither stones nor prayers nor sticks.Insults or complaints or bricksStilled the frogs determinationTo display his heart's elation.But one night a nightingaleIn the moonlight cold and palePerched upon the sumac treeCasting forth her melodyDumbstruck sat the gaping frogAnd the whole admiring bogStared towards the sumac, rapt,And, when she had ended, clapped,Ducks had swum and herons wadedTo her as she serenadedAnd a solitary loonWept, beneath the summer moon.Toads and teals and tiddlers, capturedBy her voice, cheered on, enraptured:\"Bravo! \" \"Too divine! \" \"Encore! \"So the nightingale once more,Quite unused to such applause,Sang till dawn without a pause.Next night when the NightingaleShook her head and twitched her tail,Closed an eye and fluffed a wingAnd had cleared her throat to singShe was startled by a croak.\"Sorry - was that you who spoke? \"She enquired when the frogHopped towards her from the bog.\"Yes,\" the frog replied. \"You see,I'm the frog who owns this treeIn this bog I've long been knownFor my splendid baritoneAnd, of course, I wield my penFor Bog Trumpet now and then\"\"Did you… did you like my song? \"\"Not too bad - but far too long.The technique was fine of course,But it lacked a certain force\".\"Oh! \" the nightingale confessed.Greatly flattered and impressedThat a critic of such noteHad discussed her art and throat:\"I don't think the song's divine.But - oh, well - at least it's mine\".\"That's not much to boast about\".Said the heartless frog. \"WithoutProper training such as I- And few others can supply.You'll remain a mere beginner.But with me you'll be a winner\"\"Dearest frog\", the nightingaleBreathed: \"This is a fairy tale -And you are Mozart in disguiseCome to earth before my eyes\".\"Well I charge a modest fee.\"\"Oh! \" \"But it won't hurt, you'll see\"Now the nightingale inspired,Flushed with confidence, and firedWith both art and adoration,Sang - and was a huge sensation.Animals for miles aroundFlocked towards the magic sound,And the frog with great precisionCounted heads and charged admission.Though next morning it was raining,He began her vocal training.\"But I can't sing in this weather\"\"Come my dear - we'll sing together.Just put on your scarf and sash,Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"So the frog and nightingaleJourneyed up and down the scaleFor six hours, till she was shiveringand her voice was hoarse and quivering.Though subdued and sleep deprived,In the night her throat revived,And the sumac tree was bowed,With a breathless, titled crowd:Owl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent,Mallard and Milady Trent,Martin Cardinal Mephisto,And the Coot of Monte Cristo,Ladies with tiaras glitteringIn the interval sat twittering -And the frog observed them glitterWith a joy both sweet and bitter.Every day the frog who'd sold herSongs for silver tried to scold her:\"You must practice even longerTill your voice, like mine grows stronger.In the second song last nightYou got nervous in mid-flight.And, my dear, lay on more trills:Audiences enjoy such frills.You must make your public happier:Give them something sharper snappier.We must aim for better billings.You still owe me sixty shillings.\"Day by day the nightingaleGrew more sorrowful and pale.Night on night her tired songZipped and trilled and bounced along,Till the birds and beasts grew tiredAt a voice so uninspiredAnd the ticket office grossCrashed, and she grew more morose -For her ears were now addictedTo applause quite unrestricted,And to sing into the nightAll alone gave no delight.Now the frog puffed up with rage.\"Brainless bird - you're on the stage -Use your wits and follow fashion.Puff your lungs out with your passion.\"Trembling, terrified to fail,Blind with tears, the nightingaleHeard him out in silence, tried,Puffed up, burst a vein, and died.Said the frog: \"I tried to teach her,But she was a stupid creature -Far too nervous, far too tense.Far too prone to influence.Well, poor bird - she should have knownThat your song must be your own.That's why I sing with panache:\"Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"And the foghorn of the frogBlared unrivalled through the bog.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn lifeone is alwaysbalancinglike we juggle our mothersagainst our fathersor one teacheragainst another(only to balance our grade average)  3 grains of saltto one ounce truthour sweet black essenceor the funky honkies down the streetand lately i've begun wonderingif you're trying to tell me somethingwe used to talk all nightand do things alone togetherand i've begun(as a reaction to a feeling)  to balancethe pleasure of lonelinessagainst the painof loving you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe calm, Cool face of the riverAsked me for a kiss.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   O HYMEN!

Then,We came by night to the Fortunate Isles,And lay like fishUnder the net of our kisses.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy friends all know that I am shy,But the chipmunk is twice and shy and I.He moves with flickering indecisionLike stripes across the television.He's like the shadow of a cloud,Or Emily Dickinson read aloud.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn my young years I took pride in the fact that luck was called a lady. In fact, there were so few public acknowledgments of the female presence that I felt personally honored whenever nature and large ships were referred to as feminine. But as I matured, I began to resent being considered a sister to a changeling as fickle as luck, as aloof as an ocean, and as frivolous as nature. The phrase 'A woman always has the right to change her mind' played so aptly into the negative image of the female that I made myself a victim to an unwavering decision. Even if I made an inane and stupid choice, I stuck by it rather than 'be like a woman and change my mind.'Being a woman is hard work. Not without joy and even ecstasy, but still relentless, unending work. Becoming an old female may require only being born with certain genitalia, inheriting long-living genes and the fortune not to be run over by an out-of-control truck, but to become and remain a woman command the existence and employment of genius.The woman who survives intact and happy must be at once tender and tough. She must have convinced herself, or be in the unending process of convincing herself, that she, her values, and her choices are important. In a time a nd world where males hold sway and control, the pressure upon women to yield their rights-of-way is tremendous. And it is under those very circumstances that the woman's toughness must be in evidence.She must resist considering herself a lesser version of her male counterpart. She is not a sculptress, poetess, authoress, Jewess, Negress, or even (now rare) in university parlance a rectoress. If she is the thing, then for her own sense of self and for the education of the ill-informed she must insist with rectitude in being the thing and in being called the thing.A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but a woman called by a devaluing name will only be weakened by the misnomer. She will need to prize her tenderness and be able to display it at appropriate times in order to prevent toughness from gaining total authority and to avoid becoming a mirror image of those men who value power above life, and control over love.It is imperative that a woman keep her sense of humor intact and at the ready. She must see, even if only in secret, that she is the funniest, looniest woman in her world, which she should also see as being the most absurd world of all times. It has been said that laughter is therapeutic and amiability lengthens the life span. Women should be tough, tender, laugh as much as possible, and live long lives. The struggle for equality continues unabated, and the woman warrior who is armed with wit and courage will be among the first to celebrate victory.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPoetic Masterpiece - A Childbirth Of Profundity.Like delivery of divine revelationswhich favours calmness of wilderness; It's brought forth in Creative-Glory-Of-Solitude: An abode of Enlightenment in whose mirror of grace, purest passions reflect out from shady reality -To gratify inflamed curiosity of Inward-Eye, as it wanders around source of enchantment, seeking in expanded awareness, to capturethe essence of a phenomenon shrouded in mystery.In blessed serene mood with passionate intensity, mind labours hard to replicate imagesunveiled in exulted realm of thought.With illuminative wizardry that nudge limits of speech, The Wordsmith graced with breath of poetic creation gives life to words -freeing them from rigid implications: Soulful words that sway soul of the reader, leaving the excited spirit with an enigma to ponder.Such is the sublime nature of every Poetic Masterpiece.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo man is an island,Entire of itself,Every man is a piece of the continent,A part of the main.If a clod be washed away by the sea,Europe is the less.As well as if a promontory were.As well as if a manor of thy friend'sOr of thine own were:Any man's death diminishes me,Because I am involved in mankind,And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              THE wild bee reels from bough to bough                With his furry coat and his gauzy wing.

Is that a star? or the lamp that gleams                On some outward voyaging argosy,--                        Ah! can it be              We have lived our lives in a land of dreams!

Sweet, there is nothing left to say                But this, that love is never lost,              Keen winter stabs the breasts of May                Whose crimson roses burst his frost,                        Ships tempest-tossed              Will find a harbour in some bay,                        And so we may.              And there is nothing left to do                But to kiss once again, and part,              Nay, there is nothing we should rue,                I have my beauty,--you your Art,                        Nay, do not start,              One world was not enough for two                        Like me and you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShe is as in a field a silken tentAt midday when the sunny summer breezeHas dried the dew and all its ropes relent,So that in guys it gently sways at ease,And its supporting central cedar pole,That is its pinnacle to heavenwardAnd signifies the sureness of the soul,Seems to owe naught to any single cord,But strictly held by none, is loosely boundBy countless silken ties of love and thoughtTo every thing on earth the compass round,And only by one's going slightly tautIn the capriciousness of summer airIs of the slightlest bondage made aware.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBirds singing in the dark —Rainy dawn.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI waz whitemailedBy a white witch,Wid white magicAn white lies,Branded by a white sheepI slaved as a whitesmithNear a white spotWhere I suffered whitewater fever.Whitelisted as a whitelegI waz in de white bookAs a master of white art,It waz like white death.

And my lord he loves me well;         But, when first he breathed his vow,       I felt my bosom swell-       For the words rang as a knell,       And the voice seemed his who fell       In the battle down the dell,         And who is happy now.       But he spoke to re-assure me,         And he kissed my pallid brow,       While a reverie came o'er me,       And to the church-yard bore me,       And I sighed to him before me,       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,       \"Oh, I am happy now!\"       And thus the words were spoken,         And this the plighted vow,       And, though my faith be broken,       And, though my heart be broken,       Here is a ring, as token         That I am happy now!       Would God I could awaken!         For I dream I know not how!

The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there. I let my neighbour know beyond the hill; And on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again. We keep the wall between us as we go. To each the boulders that have fallen to each. And some are loaves and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell to make them balance: \"Stay where you are until our backs are turned!\" We wear our fingers rough with handling them. Oh, just another kind of out-door game, One on a side. It comes to little more: There where it is we do not need the wall: He is all pine and I am apple orchard. My apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. He only says, \"Good fences make good neighbours.\" Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion in his head: \"Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. Before I built a wall I'd ask to know What I was walling in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offence. Something there is that doesn't love a wall, That wants it down.\" I could say \"Elves\" to him, But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather He said it for himself. I see him there Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. He moves in darkness as it seems to me, Not of woods only and the shade of trees. He will not go behind his father's saying, And he likes having thought of it so well He says again, \"Good fences make good neighbours.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Help, help, ' said a man.

Whole families shopping at night! Aislesfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! --- and you,Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among themeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What pricebananas? Are you my Angel?I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, andfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tastingartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way doesyour beard point tonight?(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feelabsurd.)Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade toshade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles indriveways, home to our silent cottage?Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did youhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank andstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA single flow'r he sent me, since we met.All tenderly his messenger he chose;Deep-hearted, pure, with scented dew still wet -One perfect rose.I knew the language of the floweret;'My fragile leaves,' it said, 'his heart enclose.'Love long has taken for his amuletOne perfect rose.Why is it no one ever sent me yetOne perfect limousine, do you suppose?Ah no, it's always just my luck to getOne perfect rose.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England's mountains green?And was the holy Lamb of GodOn England's pleasant pastures seen? And did the Countenance DivineShine forth upon our clouded hills?And was Jerusalem builded hereAmong these dark Satanic mills? Bring me my bow of burning gold:Bring me my arrows of desire:Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!Bring me my chariot of fire. I will not cease from mental fight,Nor shall my sword sleep in my handTill we have built JerusalemIn England's green and pleasant land.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt little profits that an idle king, By this still hearth, among these barren crags, Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole Unequal laws unto a savage race, That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me. I cannot rest from travel; I will drink Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,-- And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains; but every hour is saved >From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. This is my son, mine own Telemachus, to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,-- Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill This labor, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine. There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners, Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,-- That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old; Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. Death closes all; but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks; The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends. 'T is not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Vienna there are ten little girls,a shoulder for death to cry on,and a forest of dried pigeons.There is a fragment of tomorrowin the museum of winter frost.There is a thousand-windowed dance hall.Ay, ay, ay, ay!Take this close-mouthed waltz.Little waltz, little waltz, little waltz,of itself of death, and of brandythat dips its tail in the sea.I love you, I love you, I love you,with the armchair and the book of death,down the melancholy hallway,in the iris's darkened garret,Ay, ay, ay, ay!Take this broken-waisted waltz.In Vienna there are four mirrorsin which your mouth and the ehcoes play.There is a death for pianothat paints little boys blue.There are beggars on the roof.There are fresh garlands of tears.Ay, ay, ay, ay!Take this waltz that dies in my arms.Because I love you, I love you, my love,in the attic where the children play,dreaming ancient lights of Hungarythrough the noise, the balmy afternoon,seeing sheep and irises of snowthrough the dark silence of your foreheadAy, ay, ay, ay!Take this \" I will always love you\" waltzIn Vienna I will dance with youin a costume witha river's head.See how the hyacinths line my banks!I will leave my mouth between your legs,my soul in a photographs and lilies,and in the dark wake of your footsteps,my love, my love, I will have to leaveviolin and grave, the waltzing ribbons\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.I want to be alone, so to forget the World. WantTo be forgotten  – myself –  indeed: 'Me', aSyllable only, dispersed in the night glow..\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ring is on my hand,         And the wreath is on my brow;       Satin and jewels grand       Are all at my command,         And I am happy now.       And my lord he loves me well;         But, when first he breathed his vow,       I felt my bosom swell-       For the words rang as a knell,       And the voice seemed his who fell       In the battle down the dell,         And who is happy now.       But he spoke to re-assure me,         And he kissed my pallid brow,       While a reverie came o'er me,       And to the church-yard bore me,       And I sighed to him before me,       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,       \"Oh, I am happy now!\"       And thus the words were spoken,         And this the plighted vow,       And, though my faith be broken,       And, though my heart be broken,       Here is a ring, as token         That I am happy now!       Would God I could awaken!         For I dream I know not how!       And my soul is sorely shaken       Lest an evil step be taken,-       Lest the dead who is forsaken         May not be happy now.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBarely a twelvemonth afterThe seven days war that put the world to sleep,Late in the evening the strange horses came.By then we had made our covenant with silence,But in the first few days it was so stillWe listened to our breathing and were afraid.On the second dayThe radios failed; we turned the knobs; no answer.On the third day a warship passed us, heading north,Dead bodies piled on the deck. On the sixth dayA plane plunged over us into the sea. ThereafterNothing. The radios dumb; And still they stand in corners of our kitchens,And stand, perhaps, turned on, in a million roomsAll over the world. But now if they should speak,If on a sudden they should speak again,If on the stroke of noon a voice should speak,We would not listen, we would not let it bringThat old bad world that swallowed its children quickAt one great gulp. We would not have it again.Sometimes we think of the nations lying asleep,Curled blindly in impenetrable sorrow,And then the thought confounds us with its strangeness.The tractors lie about our fields; at eveningThey look like dank sea-monsters couched and waiting.We leave them where they are and let them rust:'They'll molder away and be like other loam.'We make our oxen drag our rusty plows,Long laid aside. We have gone backFar past our fathers' land.And then, that eveningLate in the summer the strange horses came.We heard a distant tapping on the road,A deepening drumming; it stopped, went on againAnd at the corner changed to hollow thunder.We saw the headsLike a wild wave charging and were afraid.We had sold our horses in our fathers' timeTo buy new tractors. Now they were strange to usAs fabulous steeds set on an ancient shield.Or illustrations in a book of knights.We did not dare go near them. Yet they waited,Stubborn and shy, as if they had been sentBy an old command to find our whereaboutsAnd that long-lost archaic companionship.In the first moment we had never a thoughtThat they were creatures to be owned and used.Among them were some half a dozen coltsDropped in some wilderness of the broken world,Yet new as if they had come from their own Eden.Since then they have pulled our plows and borne our loadsBut that free servitude still can pierce our hearts.Our life is changed; their coming our beginning.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe shattered water made a misty din. Great waves looked over others coming in, And thought of doing something to the shore That water never did to land before. The clouds were low and hairy in the skies, Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes. You could not tell, and yet it looked as if The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff, The cliff in being backed by continent; It looked as if a night of dark intent Was coming, and not only a night, an age. Someone had better be prepared for rage. There would be more than ocean-water broken Before God's last Put out the light was spoken.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttranslated by Will KirklandThe moon came into the forgein her bustle of flowering nard.The little boy stares at her, stares.The boy is staring hard.In the shaken airthe moon moves her amrs,and shows lubricious and pure,her breasts of hard tin.\"Moon, moon, moon, run!If the gypsies come,they will use your heartto make white necklaces and rings.\"\"Let me dance, my little one.When the gypsies come,they'll find you on the anvilwith your lively eyes closed tight.\"Moon, moon, moon, run!I can feelheir horses come.\"\"Let me be, my little one,don't step on me, all starched and white!\"Closer comes the the horseman,drumming on the plain.The boy is in the forge;his eyes are closed.Through the olive grovecome the gypsies, dream and bronze,their heads held high,their hooded eyes.Oh, how the night owl calls,calling, calling from its tree!The moon is climbing through the skywith the child by the hand.They are crying in the forge,all the gypsies, shouting, crying.The air is veiwing all, views all.The air is at the viewing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tमाँ गंगा धोती धोती तन धोती माँ धोती धोती मन धोती माँतन मन धोती जन जन धोती माँकण कण धोती जीवन धोती माँसंताप तू  धोती, पाप भी धोती दीन दरिद्र के श्राप को धोती हरेक मलिन छाप को धोती तू मन के दर्पण धोती माँलोभ को धोती, क्षोभ को धोतीअहं को धोती, क्रोध को धोतीईर्ष्या, मिथ्या, कठोर को धोती दिव्या दृष्टि नयन धोती माँहर हर गंगे, हर हर गंगे तेरे द्वार पर तेरे ही मंगेभवसागर के सभी अड़ंगे दूर कर, दुःख हर लेती माँ तन धोती. मन धोती माँहम सबके जीवन धोती माँ(C)  S.

Upon her head a platted hive of straw,     Which fortified her visage from the sun,     Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw     The carcass of beauty spent and done:     Time had not scythed all that youth begun,     Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,     Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.     Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,     Which on it had conceited characters,     Laundering the silken figures in the brine     That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,     And often reading what contents it bears;     As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,     In clamours of all size, both high and low.     Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,     As they did battery to the spheres intend;     Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied     To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend     Their view right on; anon their gazes lend     To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,     The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.     Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,     Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride     For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,     Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;     Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,     And true to bondage would not break from thence,     Though slackly braided in loose negligence.     A thousand favours from a maund she drew     Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,     Which one by one she in a river threw,     Upon whose weeping margent she was set;     Like usury, applying wet to wet,     Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall     Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.     Of folded schedules had she many a one,     Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;     Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone     Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;     Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,     With sleided silk feat and affectedly     Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.     These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,     And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:     Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,     What unapproved witness dost thou bear!     Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'     This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,     Big discontent so breaking their contents.     A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--     Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew     Of court, of city, and had let go by     The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--     Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,     And, privileged by age, desires to know     In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.     So slides he down upon his grained bat,     And comely-distant sits he by her side;     When he again desires her, being sat,     Her grievance with his hearing to divide:     If that from him there may be aught applied     Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,     'Tis promised in the charity of age.     'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold     The injury of many a blasting hour,     Let it not tell your judgment I am old;     Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:     I might as yet have been a spreading flower,     Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied     Love to myself and to no love beside.     'But, woe is me! too early I attended     A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--     Of one by nature's outwards so commended,     That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:     Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;     And when in his fair parts she did abide,     She was new lodged and newly deified.     'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;     And every light occasion of the wind     Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.     What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:     Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,     For on his visage was in little drawn     What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.     'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;     His phoenix down began but to appear     Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin     Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:     Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;     And nice affections wavering stood in doubt     If best were as it was, or best without.     'His qualities were beauteous as his form,     For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;     Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm     As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,     When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.     His rudeness so with his authorized youth     Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.     'Well could he ride, and often men would say     'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:     Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,     What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop     he makes!'     And controversy hence a question takes,     Whether the horse by him became his deed,     Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.     'But quickly on this side the verdict went:     His real habitude gave life and grace     To appertainings and to ornament,     Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:     All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,     Came for additions; yet their purposed trim     Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.     'So on the tip of his subduing tongue     All kinds of arguments and question deep,     All replication prompt, and reason strong,     For his advantage still did wake and sleep:     To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,     He had the dialect and different skill,     Catching all passions in his craft of will:     'That he did in the general bosom reign     Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,     To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain     In personal duty, following where he haunted:     Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;     And dialogued for him what he would say,     Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.     'Many there were that did his picture get,     To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;     Like fools that in th' imagination set     The goodly objects which abroad they find     Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;     And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them     Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:     'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,     Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.     My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,     And was my own fee-simple, not in part,     What with his art in youth, and youth in art,     Threw my affections in his charmed power,     Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.     'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,     Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;     Finding myself in honour so forbid,     With safest distance I mine honour shielded:     Experience for me many bulwarks builded     Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil     Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.     'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent     The destined ill she must herself assay?     Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,     To put the by-past perils in her way?     Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;     For when we rage, advice is often seen     By blunting us to make our wits more keen.     'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,     That we must curb it upon others' proof;     To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,     For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.     O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!     The one a palate hath that needs will taste,     Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'     'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'     And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;     Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,     Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;     Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;     Thought characters and words merely but art,     And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.     'And long upon these terms I held my city,     Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,     Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,     And be not of my holy vows afraid:     That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;     For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,     Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.     ''All my offences that abroad you see     Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;     Love made them not: with acture they may be,     Where neither party is nor true nor kind:     They sought their shame that so their shame did find;     And so much less of shame in me remains,     By how much of me their reproach contains.     ''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,     Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,     Or my affection put to the smallest teen,     Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:     Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;     Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,     And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.     ''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,     Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;     Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me     Of grief and blushes, aptly understood     In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;     Effects of terror and dear modesty,     Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.     ''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,     With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,     I have received from many a several fair,     Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,     With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,     And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify     Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.     ''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,     Whereto his invised properties did tend;     The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard     Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;     The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend     With objects manifold: each several stone,     With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.     ''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,     Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,     Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,     But yield them up where I myself must render,     That is, to you, my origin and ender;     For these, of force, must your oblations be,     Since I their altar, you enpatron me.     ''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,     Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;     Take all these similes to your own command,     Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;     What me your minister, for you obeys,     Works under you; and to your audit comes     Their distract parcels in combined sums.     ''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,     Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;     Which late her noble suit in court did shun,     Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;     For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,     But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,     To spend her living in eternal love.     ''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave     The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,     Playing the place which did no form receive,     Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?     She that her fame so to herself contrives,     The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,     And makes her absence valiant, not her might.     ''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:     The accident which brought me to her eye     Upon the moment did her force subdue,     And now she would the caged cloister fly:     Religious love put out Religion's eye:     Not to be tempted, would she be immured,     And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.     ''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!     The broken bosoms that to me belong     Have emptied all their fountains in my well,     And mine I pour your ocean all among:     I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,     Must for your victory us all congest,     As compound love to physic your cold breast.     ''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,     Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,     Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,     All vows and consecrations giving place:     O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,     In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,     For thou art all, and all things else are thine.     ''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth     Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,     How coldly those impediments stand forth     Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!     Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,     'gainst shame,     And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,     The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.     ''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,     Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;     And supplicant their sighs to you extend,     To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,     Lending soft audience to my sweet design,     And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath     That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'     'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,     Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;     Each cheek a river running from a fount     With brinish current downward flow'd apace:     O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!     Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses     That flame through water which their hue encloses.     'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies     In the small orb of one particular tear!     But with the inundation of the eyes     What rocky heart to water will not wear?     What breast so cold that is not warmed here?     O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,     Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.     'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,     Even there resolved my reason into tears;     There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,     Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;     Appear to him, as he to me appears,     All melting; though our drops this difference bore,     His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.     'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,     Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,     Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,     Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,     In either's aptness, as it best deceives,     To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,     Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.     'That not a heart which in his level came     Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,     Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;     And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:     Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;     When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,     He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.     'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace     The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;     That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,     Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.     Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?     Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make     What I should do again for such a sake.

Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains, And rising on his hands, he looks in on me Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something I should have done by daylight, and indeed, After the ground is frozen, I should have done Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney To make fun of my way of doing things, Or else fun of Orion's having caught me. Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights These forces are obliged to pay respect to?' So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming, Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming He burned his house down for the fire insurance And spent the proceeds on a telescope To satisfy a lifelong curiosity About our place among the infinities. `What do you want with one of those blame things?' I asked him well beforehand. `Don't you get one!' `Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything More blameless in the sense of being less A weapon in our human fight,' he said. `I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.' There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move, Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years Trying to sell his farm and then not selling, He burned his house down for the fire insurance And bought the telescope with what it came to. He had been heard to say by several: `The best thing that we're put here for's to see; The strongest thing that's given us to see with's A telescope. Someone in every town Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one. In Littleton it might as well be me.' After such loose talk it was no surprise When he did what he did and burned his house down. Mean laughter went about the town that day To let him know we weren't the least imposed on, And he could wait---we'd see to him tomorrow. But the first thing next morning we reflected If one by one we counted people out For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long To get so we had no one left to live with. For to be social is to be forgiving. Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us, We don't cut off from coming to church suppers, But what we miss we go to him and ask for. He promptly gives it back, that is if still Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of. It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad About his telescope. Beyond the age Of being given one for Christmas gift, He had to take the best way he knew how To find himself in one. Well, all we said was He took a strange thing to be roguish over. Some sympathy was wasted on the house, A good old-timer dating back along; But a house isn't sentient; the house Didn't feel anything. And if it did, Why not regard it as a sacrifice, And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire, Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction? Out of a house and so out of a farm At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn To earn a living on the Concord railroad, As under-ticket-agent at a station Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets, Was setting out, up track and down, not plants As on a farm, but planets, evening stars That varied in their hue from red to green. He got a good glass for six hundred dollars. His new job gave him leisure for stargazing. Often he bid me come and have a look Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside, At a star quaking in the other end. I recollect a night of broken clouds And underfoot snow melted down to ice, And melting further in the wind to mud. Bradford and I had out the telescope. We spread our two legs as we spread its three, Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it, And standing at our leisure till the day broke, Said some of the best things we ever said. That telescope was christened the Star-Splitter, Because it didn't do a thing but split A star in two or three, the way you split A globule of quicksilver in your hand With one stroke of your finger in the middle. It's a star-splitter if there ever was one, And ought to do some good if splitting stars 'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood. We've looked and looked, but after all where are we? Do we know any better where we are, And how it stands between the night tonight And a man with a smoky lantern chimney? How different from the way it ever stood?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonneor being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelonapartly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastianpartly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurtpartly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birchespartly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuaryit is hard to believe when I'm with you that there can be anything as stillas solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of itin the warm New York 4 o'clock light we are drifting back and forthbetween each other like a tree breathing through its spectaclesand the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paintyou suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did themI lookat you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the worldexcept possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it's in the Frickwhich thank heavens you haven't gone to yet so we can go together the first timeand the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurismjust as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase orat a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow meand what good does all the research of the Impressionists do themwhen they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sankor for that matter Marino Marini when he didn't pick the rider as carefullyas the horseit seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experiencewhich is not going to go wasted on me which is why I am telling you about it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Augustus Gloop! Augustus Gloop!The great big greedy nincompoop!How long could we allow this beastTo gorge and guzzle, feed and feastOn everything he wanted to?Great Scott! It simply wouldn't do!However long this pig might live,We're positive he'd never giveEven the smallest bit of funOr happiness to anyone.So what we do in cases suchAs this, we use the gentle touch,And carefully we take the bratAnd turn him into something thatWill give great pleasure to us all–A doll, for instance, or a ball,Or marbles or a rocking horse.But this revolting boy, of course,Was so unutterably vile,So greedy, foul, and infantileHe left a most disgusting tasteInside our mouths, and so in hasteWe chose a thing that, come what may,Would take the nasty taste away.'Come on!' we cried, 'The time is ripeTo send him shooting up the pipe!He has to go! It has to be!'And very soon, he's going to seeInside the room to which he's goneSome funny things are going on.But don't, dear children, be alarmed;Augustus Gloop will not be harmed,Although, of course, we must admitHe will be altered quite a bit.He'll be quite changed from what he's been,When he goes through the fudge machine:Slowly, the wheels go round and round,The cogs begin to grind and pound;A hundred knives go slice, slice, slice;We add some sugar, cream, and spice;We boil him for a minute more,Until we're absolutely sureThat all the greed and all the gallIs boiled away for once and all.Then out he comes! And now! By grace!A miracle has taken place!This boy, who only just beforeWas loathed by men from shore to shore,This greedy brute, this louse's ear,Is loved by people everywhere!For who could hate or bear a grudgeAgainst a luscious bit of fudge?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA thing of beauty is a joy for ever: Its lovliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; but still will keep A bower quiet for us, and a sleep Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing A flowery band to bind us to the earth, Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, Some shape of beauty moves away the pall From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon For simple sheep; and such are daffodils With the green world they live in; and clear rills That for themselves a cooling covert make 'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake, Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms: And such too is the grandeur of the dooms We have imagined for the mighty dead; An endless fountain of immortal drink, Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he      knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so      much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my      state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that.  The      church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she      does belongs to all.  When she baptizes a child, that action      concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which      is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member.      And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is      of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is      not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language;      and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several      translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness,      some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every      translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves      again for that library where every book shall lie open to one      another.  As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not      upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this      bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the      door by this sickness.  There was a contention as far as a suit (in      which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were      mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers      first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring      first that rose earliest.  If we understand aright the dignity of      this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to      make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be      ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.  The bell doth toll for him      that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that      minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God.      Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes      off his eye from a comet when that breaks out?  Who bends not his      ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove      it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this      world?  No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece      of the continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by      the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as      well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's      death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and      therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for      thee.  Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing      of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but      must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the      misery of our neighbours.  Truly it were an excusable covetousness      if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath      enough of it.  No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and      ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction.  If a man      carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none      coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he      travels.  Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not      current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our      home, heaven, by it.  Another man may be sick too, and sick to      death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a      mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his      affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this      consideration of another's danger I take mine own into      contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my      God, who is our only security.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf i can't do what i want to do then my job is to not do what i don't want to doIt's not the same thing but it's the best i can doIf i can't have what i want . . . then my job is to want what i've got and be satisfied that at least there is something more to wantSince i can't go where i need to go . . . then i must . . . go where the signs point through always understanding parallel movement isn't lateralWhen i can't express what i really feel i practice feeling what i can express and none of it is equalI know but that's why mankind alone among the animals learns to cry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tO, to have a little house! To own the hearth and stool and all! The heaped up sods against the fire, The pile of turf against the wall! To have a clock with weights and chains And pendulum swinging up and down! A dresser filled with shining delph, Speckled and white and blue and brown! I could be busy all the day Clearing and sweeping hearth and floor, And fixing on their shelf again My white and blue and speckled store! I could be quiet there at night Beside the fire and by myself, Sure of a bed and loth to leave The ticking clock and the shining delph! Och! but I'm weary of mist and dark, And roads where there's never a house nor bush, And tired I am of bog and road, And the crying wind and the lonesome hush! And I am praying to God on high, And I am praying Him night and day, For a little house - a house of my own Out of the wind's and the rain's way.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDown they go!Hail and snow!Freezes and sneezes and noses will blow!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe glides so swiftlyBack into the grass-Gives me the courtesy of roadTo let me pass,That I am half ashamedTo seek a stoneTo kill him.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI1 Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knife us ... 2 Wearied we keep awake because the night is silent ...3 Low drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient ...4 Worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous,5   But nothing happens.6 Watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire.7 Like twitching agonies of men among its brambles.8 Northward incessantly, the flickering gunnery rumbles,9 Far off, like a dull rumour of some other war.10   What are we doing here?11 The poignant misery of dawn begins to grow ...12 We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy.13 Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army14 Attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray,15   But nothing happens. 16 Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence.17 Less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow,18 With sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause and renew,19 We watch them wandering up and down the wind's nonchalance,20   But nothing happens. II21 Pale flakes with lingering stealth come feeling for our faces--22 We cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed,23 Deep into grassier ditches. So we drowse, sun-dozed,24 Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses.25   Is it that we are dying?26 Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires glozed27 With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;28 For hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs;29 Shutters and doors all closed: on us the doors are closed--30   We turn back to our dying.31 Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;32 Now ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit.33 For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;34 Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,35   For love of God seems dying.36 To-night, His frost will fasten on this mud and us,37 Shrivelling many hands and puckering foreheads crisp.38 The burying-party, picks and shovels in their shaking grasp,39 Pause over half-known faces. All their eyes are ice,40   But nothing happens.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow. The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but mine will hang upon thy breast. Wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, and when I bring it to thee as my offering thou rewardest me with thy grace.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe wear the mask that grins and lies,It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,--This debt we pay to human guile;With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be overwise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, whileWe wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our criesTo thee from tortured souls arise.We sing, but oh the clay is vileBeneath our feet, and long the mile;But let the world dream otherwise,We wear the mask!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJanuary brings the snow,makes our feet and fingers glow.February brings the rain,Thaws the frozen lake again.March brings breezes loud and shrill,stirs the dancing daffodil.April brings the primrose sweet,Scatters daises at our feet.May brings flocks of pretty lambs,Skipping by their fleecy damns.June brings tulips, lilies, roses,Fills the children's hand with posies.Hot july brings cooling showers,Apricots and gillyflowers.August brings the sheaves of corn,Then the harvest home is borne.Warm september brings the fruit,Sportsmen then begin to shoot.Fresh October brings the pheasents,Then to gather nuts is pleasent.Dull November brings the blast,Then the leaves are whirling fast.Chill December brings the sleet,Blazing fire, and Christmas treat.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly dumb guys fight.If I wasn't dumbI wouldn't be fightin'.I could make six dollars a dayOn the docksAnd I'd save more than I do now.Only dumb guys fight.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow countlessly they congregateO'er our tumultuous snow,Which flows in shapes as tall as treesWhen wintry winds do blow!--As if with keenness for our fate,Our faltering few steps onTo white rest, and a place of restInvisible at dawn,--And yet with neither love nor hate,Those stars like some snow-whiteMinerva's snow-white marble eyesWithout the gift of sight.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEVEN the bravest that are slain\t  Shall not dissemble their surprise\tOn waking to find valor reign,\t  Even as on earth, in paradise; \tAnd where they sought without the sword\t          Wide fields of asphodel fore’er,\tTo find that the utmost reward\t  Of daring should be still to dare.\t The light of heaven falls whole and white\t  And is not shattered into dyes,\t        The light for ever is morning light; \t  The hills are verdured pasture-wise; \tThe angel hosts with freshness go,\t  And seek with laughter what to brave; —\tAnd binding all is the hushed snow\t          Of the far-distant breaking wave.\t And from a cliff-top is proclaimed\t  The gathering of the souls for birth,\tThe trial by existence named,\t  The obscuration upon earth.\t        And the slant spirits trooping by\t  In streams and cross- and counter-streams\tCan but give ear to that sweet cry\t  For its suggestion of what dreams! \t And the more loitering are turned\t          To view once more the sacrifice\tOf those who for some good discerned\t  Will gladly give up paradise.\tAnd a white shimmering concourse rolls\t  Toward the throne to witness there\t        The speeding of devoted souls\t  Which God makes his especial care.\t And none are taken but who will,\t  Having first heard the life read out\tThat opens earthward, good and ill,\t          Beyond the shadow of a doubt; \tAnd very beautifully God limns,\t  And tenderly, life’s little dream,\tBut naught extenuates or dims,\t  Setting the thing that is supreme.\t         Nor is there wanting in the press\t  Some spirit to stand simply forth,\tHeroic in its nakedness,\t  Against the uttermost of earth.\tThe tale of earth’s unhonored things\t          Sounds nobler there than ’neath the sun; \tAnd the mind whirls and the heart sings,\t  And a shout greets the daring one.\t But always God speaks at the end:\t  ’One thought in agony of strife\t        The bravest would have by for friend,\t  The memory that he chose the life; \tBut the pure fate to which you go\t  Admits no memory of choice,\tOr the woe were not earthly woe\t          To which you give the assenting voice.’\t And so the choice must be again,\t  But the last choice is still the same; \tAnd the awe passes wonder then,\t  And a hush falls for all acclaim.\t        And God has taken a flower of gold\t  And broken it, and used therefrom\tThe mystic link to bind and hold\t  Spirit to matter till death come.\t ‘Tis of the essence of life here,\t          Though we choose greatly, still to lack\tThe lasting memory at all clear,\t  That life has for us on the wrack\tNothing but what we somehow chose; \t  Thus are we wholly stripped of pride\t        In the pain that has but one close,\t  Bearing it crushed and mystified.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGetting a man to love you is easyOnly be honest about your wants asWoman.

Thought the house is dark and shuttered, I can see a flickerin' flutter, And I know what it's about. There's a light on in the attic. I can see it from the outside. And I know you're on the inside... lookin' out.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Tis eight o'clock,--a clear March night, The moon is up,--the sky is blue, The owlet, in the moonlight air, Shouts from nobody knows where; He lengthens out his lonely shout, Halloo! halloo! a long halloo! --Why bustle thus about your door, What means this bustle, Betty Foy? Why are you in this mighty fret? And why on horseback have you set Him whom you love, your Idiot Boy? Scarcely a soul is out of bed; Good Betty, put him down again; His lips with joy they burr at you; But, Betty! what has he to do With stirrup, saddle, or with rein? But Betty's bent on her intent; For her good neighbour, Susan Gale, Old Susan, she who dwells alone, Is sick, and makes a piteous moan As if her very life would fail. There's not a house within a mile, No hand to help them in distress; Old Susan lies a-bed in pain, And sorely puzzled are the twain, For what she ails they cannot guess. And Betty's husband's at the wood, Where by the week he doth abide, A woodman in the distant vale; There's none to help poor Susan Gale; What must be done? what will betide? And Betty from the lane has fetched Her Pony, that is mild and good; Whether he be in joy or pain, Feeding at will along the lane, Or bringing faggots from the wood. And he is all in travelling trim,-- And, by the moonlight, Betty Foy Has on the well-girt saddle set (The like was never heard of yet) Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. And he must post without delay Across the bridge and through the dale, And by the church, and o'er the down, To bring a Doctor from the town, Or she will die, old Susan Gale. There is no need of boot or spur, There is no need of whip or wand; For Johnny has his holly-bough, And with a 'hurly-burly' now He shakes the green bough in his hand. And Betty o'er and o'er has told The Boy, who is her best delight, Both what to follow, what to shun, What do, and what to leave undone, How turn to left, and how to right. And Betty's most especial charge, Was, 'Johnny! Johnny! mind that you Come home again, nor stop at all,-- Come home again, whate'er befall, My Johnny, do, I pray you do.' To this did Johnny answer make, Both with his head and with his hand, And proudly shook the bridle too; And then! his words were not a few, Which Betty well could understand. And now that Johnny is just going, Though Betty's in a mighty flurry, She gently pats the Pony's side, On which her Idiot Boy must ride, And seems no longer in a hurry. But when the Pony moved his legs, Oh! then for the poor Idiot Boy! For joy he cannot hold the bridle, For joy his head and heels are idle, He's idle all for very joy. And while the Pony moves his legs, In Johnny's left hand you may see The green bough motionless and dead: The Moon that shines above his head Is not more still and mute than he. His heart it was so full of glee, That till full fifty yards were gone, He quite forgot his holly whip, And all his skill in horsemanship: Oh! happy, happy, happy John. And while the Mother, at the door, Stands fixed, her face with joy o'erflows, Proud of herself, and proud of him, She sees him in his travelling trim, How quietly her Johnny goes. The silence of her Idiot Boy, What hopes it sends to Betty's heart! He's at the guide-post--he turns right; She watches till he's out of sight, And Betty will not then depart. Burr, burr--now Johnny's lips they burr, As loud as any mill, or near it; Meek as a lamb the Pony moves, And Johnny makes the noise he loves, 0 And Betty listens, glad to hear it. Away she hies to Susan Gale: Her Messenger's in merry tune; The owlets hoot, the owlets curr, And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr, As on he goes beneath the moon. His steed and he right well agree; For of this Pony there's a rumour, That, should he lose his eyes and ears, And should he live a thousand years, He never will be out of humour. But then he is a horse that thinks! And when he thinks, his pace is slack; Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, Yet, for his life, he cannot tell What he has got upon his back. So through the moonlight lanes they go, And far into the moonlight dale, And by the church, and o'er the down, To bring a Doctor from the town, To comfort poor old Susan Gale. And Betty, now at Susan's side, Is in the middle of her story, What speedy help her Boy will bring, With many a most diverting thing, Of Johnny's wit, and Johnny's glory. And Betty, still at Susan's side, By this time is not quite so flurried: Demure with porringer and plate She sits, as if in Susan's fate Her life and soul were buried. But Betty, poor good woman! she, You plainly in her face may read it, Could lend out of that moment's store Five years of happiness or more To any that might need it. But yet I guess that now and then With Betty all was not so well; And to the road she turns her ears, And thence full many a sound she hears, Which she to Susan will not tell. Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans; 'As sure as there's a moon in heaven,' Cries Betty, 'he'll be back again; They'll both be here--'tis almost ten-- Both will be here before eleven.' Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans; The clock gives warning for eleven; 'Tis on the stroke--'He must be near,' Quoth Betty, 'and will soon be here, As sure as there's a moon in heaven.' The clock is on the stroke of twelve, And Johnny is not yet in sight: --The Moon's in heaven, as Betty sees, But Betty is not quite at ease; And Susan has a dreadful night. And Betty, half an hour ago, On Johnny vile reflections cast: 'A little idle sauntering Thing!' With other names, an endless string; But now that time is gone and past. And Betty's drooping at the heart, That happy time all past and gone, 'How can it be he is so late? The Doctor, he has made him wait; Susan! they'll both be here anon.' And Susan's growing worse and worse, And Betty's in a sad 'quandary'; And then there's nobody to say If she must go, or she must stay! --She's in a sad 'quandary'. The clock is on the stroke of one; But neither Doctor nor his Guide Appears along the moonlight road; There's neither horse nor man abroad, And Betty's still at Susan's side. And Susan now begins to fear Of sad mischances not a few, That Johnny may perhaps be drowned; Or lost, perhaps, and never found; Which they must both for ever rue. She prefaced half a hint of this With, 'God forbid it should be true!' At the first word that Susan said Cried Betty, rising from the bed, 'Susan, I'd gladly stay with you. 'I must be gone, I must away: Consider, Johnny's but half-wise; Susan, we must take care of him, If he is hurt in life or limb'-- 'Oh God forbid!' poor Susan cries. 'What can I do?' says Betty, going, 'What can I do to ease your pain? Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay; I fear you're in a dreadful way, But I shall soon be back again.' 'Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go! There's nothing that can ease my pain,' Then off she hies, but with a prayer That God poor Susan's life would spare, 0 Till she comes back again. So, through the moonlight lane she goes, And far into the moonlight dale; And how she ran, and how she walked, And all that to herself she talked, Would surely be a tedious tale. In high and low, above, below, In great and small, in round and square, In tree and tower was Johnny seen, In bush and brake, in black and green; 'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where. And while she crossed the bridge, there came A thought with which her heart is sore-- Johnny perhaps his horse forsook, To hunt the moon within the brook, And never will be heard of more. Now is she high upon the down, Alone amid a prospect wide; There's neither Johnny nor his Horse Among the fern or in the gorse; There's neither Doctor nor his Guide. 'O saints! what is become of him? Perhaps he's climbed into an oak, Where he will stay till he is dead; Or, sadly he has been misled, And joined the wandering gipsy-folk. 'Or him that wicked Pony's carried To the dark cave, the goblin's hall; Or in the castle he's pursuing Among the ghosts his own undoing; Or playing with the waterfall.' At poor old Susan then she railed, While to the town she posts away; 'If Susan had not been so ill, Alas! I should have had him still, My Johnny, till my dying day.' Poor Betty, in this sad distemper, The Doctor's self could hardly spare: Unworthy things she talked, and wild; Even he, of cattle the most mild, The Pony had his share. But now she's fairly in the town, And to the Doctor's door she hies; 'Tis silence all on every side; The town so long, the town so wide, Is silent as the skies. And now she's at the Doctor's door, She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap; The Doctor at the casement shows His glimmering eyes that peep and doze! And one hand rubs his old night-cap. 'O Doctor! Doctor! where's my Johnny?' 'I'm here, what is't you want with me?' 'O Sir! you know I'm Betty Foy, And I have lost my poor dear Boy, You know him--him you often see; 'He's not so wise as some folks be:' 'The devil take his wisdom!' said The Doctor, looking somewhat grim, 'What, Woman! should I know of him?' And, grumbling, he went back to bed! 'O woe is me! O woe is me! Here will I die, here will I die; I thought to find my lost one here, But he is neither far nor near, Oh! what a wretched Mother I!' She stops, she stands, she looks about; Which way to turn she cannot tell. Poor Betty! it would ease her pain If she had heart to knock again; --The clock strikes three--a dismal knell! Then up along the town she hies, No wonder if her senses fail; This piteous news so much it shocked her, She quite forgot to send the Doctor, To comfort poor old Susan Gale. And now she's high upon the down, And she can see a mile of road: 'O cruel! I'm almost threescore; Such night as this was ne'er before, There's not a single soul abroad.' She listens, but she cannot hear The foot of horse, the voice of man; The streams with softest sound are flowing, The grass you almost hear it growing, You hear it now, if e'er you can. The owlets through the long blue night Are shouting to each other still: Fond lovers! yet not quite hob nob, They lengthen out the tremulous sob, That echoes far from hill to hill. Poor Betty now has lost all hope, Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin, A green-grown pond she just has past, And from the brink she hurries fast, Lest she should drown herself therein. And now she sits her down and weeps; Such tears she never shed before; 'Oh dear, dear Pony! my sweet joy! Oh carry back my Idiot Boy! 0 And we will ne'er o'erload thee more.' A thought is come into her head: The Pony he is mild and good, And we have always used him well; Perhaps he's gone along the dell, And carried Johnny to the wood. Then up she springs as if on wings; She thinks no more of deadly sin; If Betty fifty ponds should see, The last of all her thoughts would be To drown herself therein. O Reader! now that I might tell What Johnny and his Horse are doing What they've been doing all this time, Oh could I put it into rhyme, A most delightful tale pursuing! Perhaps, and no unlikely thought! He with his Pony now doth roam The cliffs and peaks so high that are, To lay his hands upon a star, And in his pocket bring it home. Perhaps he's turned himself about, His face unto his horse's tail, And, still and mute, in wonder lost, All silent as a horseman-ghost, He travels slowly down the vale. And now, perhaps, is hunting sheep, A fierce and dreadful hunter he; Yon valley, now so trim and green, In five months' time, should he be seen, A desert wilderness will be! Perhaps, with head and heels on fire, And like the very soul of evil, He's galloping away, away, And so will gallop on for aye, The bane of all that dread the devil! I to the Muses have been bound These fourteen years, by strong indentures: O gentle Muses! let me tell But half of what to him befell; He surely met with strange adventures. O gentle Muses! is this kind? Why will ye thus my suit repel? Why of your further aid bereave me? And can ye thus unfriended leave me Ye Muses! whom I love so well? Who's yon, that, near the waterfall, Which thunders down with headlong force, Beneath the moon, yet shining fair, As careless as if nothing were, Sits upright on a feeding horse? Unto his horse--there feeding free, He seems, I think, the rein to give; Of moon or stars he takes no heed; Of such we in romances read: --'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live. And that's the very Pony, too! Where is she, where is Betty Foy? She hardly can sustain her fears; The roaring waterfall she hears, And cannot find her Idiot Boy. Your Pony's worth his weight in gold: Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy! She's coming from among the trees, And now all full in view she sees Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. And Betty sees the Pony too: Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy? It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost, 'Tis he whom you so long have lost, He whom you love, your Idiot Boy. She looks again--her arms are up-- She screams--she cannot move for joy; She darts, as with a torrent's force, She almost has o'erturned the Horse, And fast she holds her Idiot Boy. And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud; Whether in cunning or in joy I cannot tell; but while he laughs, Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs To hear again her Idiot Boy. And now she's at the Pony's tail, And now is at the Pony's head,-- On that side now, and now on this; And, almost stifled with her bliss, A few sad tears does Betty shed. She kisses o'er and o'er again Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy; She's happy here, is happy there, She is uneasy every where; Her limbs are all alive with joy. She pats the Pony, where or when She knows not, happy Betty Foy! The little Pony glad may be, But he is milder far than she, You hardly can perceive his joy. 'Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor; You've done your best, and that is all:' She took the reins, when this was said, And gently turned the Pony's head 0 From the loud waterfall. By this the stars were almost gone, The moon was setting on the hill, So pale you scarcely looked at her: The little birds began to stir, Though yet their tongues were still. The Pony, Betty, and her Boy, Wind slowly through the woody dale; And who is she, betimes abroad, That hobbles up the steep rough road? Who is it, but old Susan Gale? Long time lay Susan lost in thought; And many dreadful fears beset her, Both for her Messenger and Nurse; And, as her mind grew worse and worse, Her body--it grew better. She turned, she tossed herself in bed, On all sides doubts and terrors met her; Point after point did she discuss; And, while her mind was fighting thus, Her body still grew better. 'Alas! what is become of them? These fears can never be endured; I'll to the wood.'--The word scarce said, Did Susan rise up from her bed, As if by magic cured. Away she goes up hill and down, And to the wood at length is come; She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting; Oh me! it is a merry meeting As ever was in Christendom. The owls have hardly sung their last, While our four travellers homeward wend; The owls have hooted all night long, And with the owls began my song, And with the owls must end. For while they all were travelling home, Cried Betty, 'Tell us, Johnny, do, Where all this long night you have been, What you have heard, what you have seen: And, Johnny, mind you tell us true.' Now Johnny all night long had heard The owls in tuneful concert strive; No doubt too he the moon had seen; For in the moonlight he had been From eight o'clock till five. And thus, to Betty's question, he Made answer, like a traveller bold, (His very words I give to you,) 'The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo, And the sun did shine so cold!' --Thus answered Johnny in his glory, And that was all his travel's story,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTonight I can write the saddest lines.Write, for example,'The night is shatteredand the blue stars shiver in the distance.'The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.Tonight I can write the saddest lines.I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.Through nights like this one I held her in my armsI kissed her again and again under the endless sky.She loved me sometimes, and I loved her too.How could one not have loved her great still eyes.Tonight I can write the saddest lines.To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.What does it matter that my love could not keep her.The night is shattered and she is not with me.This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.My sight searches for her as though to go to her.My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.The same night whitening the same trees.We, of that time, are no longer the same.I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.Another's. She will be another's. Like my kisses before.Her voide. Her bright body. Her inifinite eyes.I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. Love is so short, forgetting is so long.Because through nights like this one I held her in my armsmy sould is not satisfied that it has lost her.Though this be the last pain that she makes me sufferand these the last verses that I write for her.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt's such aBoreBeing alwaysPoor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow as I was young and easy under the apple boughsAbout the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,The night above the dingle starry,Time let me hail and climbGolden in the heydays of his eyes,And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple townsAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leavesTrail with daisies and barleyDown the rivers of the windfall light.And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barnsAbout the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,In the sun that is young once only,Time let me play and beGolden in the mercy of his means,And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calvesSang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear andcold,And the sabbath rang slowlyIn the pebbles of the holy streams.All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hayFields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it wasairAnd playing, lovely and wateryAnd fire green as grass.And nightly under the simple starsAs I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, thenightjarsFlying with the ricks, and the horsesFlashing into the dark.And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer whiteWith the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was allShining, it was Adam and maiden,The sky gathered againAnd the sun grew round that very day.So it must have been after the birth of the simple lightIn the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walkingwarmOut of the whinnying green stableOn to the fields of praise.And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay houseUnder the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,In the sun born over and over,I ran my heedless ways,My wishes raced through the house high hayAnd nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allowsIn all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songsBefore the children green and goldenFollow him out of grace.Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time wouldtake meUp to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,In the moon that is always rising,Nor that riding to sleepI should hear him fly with the high fieldsAnd wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,Time held me green and dyingThough I sang in my chains like the sea.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGlory falls around us as we sob a dirge of desolation on the Cross and hatred is the ballast of the rock which his upon our necks and underfoot. We have woven robes of silk and clothed our nakedness with tapestry. From crawling on this murky planet's floor we soar beyond the birds and through the clouds and edge our waays from hate and blind despair and bring horror to our brothers, and to our sisters cheer. We grow despite the horror that we feed upon our own tomorrow. We grow.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweet, I blame you not, for mine the fault was, had I not been made of common clayI had climbed the higher heights unclimbed yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.From the wildness of my wasted passion I had struck a better, clearer song,Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled with some Hydra-headed wrong.Had my lips been smitten into music by the kisses that but made them bleed,You had walked with Bice and the angels on that verdant and enamelled meed.I had trod the road which Dante treading saw the suns of seven circles shine,Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening, as they opened to the Florentine.And the mighty nations would have crowned me, who am crownless now and without name,And some orient dawn had found me kneeling on the threshold of the House of Fame.I had sat within that marble circle where the oldest bard is as the young,And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the lyre's strings are ever strung.Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out the poppy-seeded wine,With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead, clasped the hand of noble love in mine.And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush the burnished bosom of the dove,Two young lovers lying in an orchard would have read the story of our love;Would have read the legend of my passion, known the bitter secret of my heart,Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as we two are fated now to part.For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by the cankerworm of truth,And no hand can gather up the fallen withered petals of the rose of youth.Yet I am not sorry that I loved you -ah! what else had I a boy to do? - For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the silent-footed years pursue.Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and when once the storm of youth is past,Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death the silent pilot comes at last.And within the grave there is no pleasure, for the blindworm battens on the root,And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree of Passion bears no fruit.Ah! what else had I to do but love you? God's own mother was less dear to me,And less dear the Cytheraean rising like an argent lily from the sea.I have made my choice, have lived my poems, and, though youth is gone in wasted days,I have found the lover's crown of myrtle better than the poet's crown of bays.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read, 'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large Down in the meadow, where is richer feed, And will not mind to hit their proper targe. Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too, Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again, What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true, Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men. Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough, What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town, If juster battles are enacted now Between the ants upon this hummock's crown? Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn, If red or black the gods will favor most, Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn, Struggling to heave some rock against the host. Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour, For now I've business with this drop of dew, And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower-- I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue. This bed of herd's grass and wild oats was spread Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use. A clover tuft is pillow for my head, And violets quite overtop my shoes. And now the cordial clouds have shut all in, And gently swells the wind to say all's well; The scattered drops are falling fast and thin, Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell. I am well drenched upon my bed of oats; But see that globe come rolling down its stem, Now like a lonely planet there it floats, And now it sinks into my garment's hem. Drip drip the trees for all the country round, And richness rare distills from every bough; The wind alone it is makes every sound, Shaking down crystals on the leaves below. For shame the sun will never show himself, Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so; My dripping locks--they would become an elf, Who in a beaded coat does gayly go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom Child's Garden of VersesI have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow--Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,And he sometimes goes so little that there's none of him at all.He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.He stays so close behind me, he's a coward you can see;I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!One morning, very early, before the sun was up,I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore and more frequently the edgesof me dissolve and I becomea wish to assimilate the world, includingyou, if possible through the skinlike a cool plant's tricks with oxygenand live by a harmless green burning.I would not consumeyou or everfinish, you would still be theresurrounding me, completeas the air.Unfortunately I don't have leaves.Instead I have eyesand teeth and other non-greenthings which rule out osmosis.So be careful, I mean it,I give you fair warning:This kind of hunger drawseverything into its ownspace; nor can wetalk it all over, have a calmrational discussion.There is no reason for this, onlya starved dog's logic about bones.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDown behind the dustbinI met a dog called Ted.‘Leave me alone,’ he says,‘I’m just going to bed.’Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Roger.‘Do you own this bin?’ I said.‘No. I’m only a lodger.’Down behind the dustbinI met a dog called Sue.‘What are you doing here?’ I said.‘I’ve got nothing else to do.’\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Fathers sit on benches   their flesh counts every plank   the slats leave dents of darknessdeep in their withered flanks.They nod like broken candles   all waxed and burnt profound   they say 'It's understandingthat makes the world go round.'There in those pleated faces   I see the auction block   the chains and slavery's cofflesthe whip and lash and stock.My Fathers speak in voices   that shred my fact and sound   they say 'It's our submissionthat makes the world go round.'They used the finest cunning   their naked wits and wiles   the lowly Uncle Tommingand Aunt Jemima's smiles.They've laughed to shield their crying   then shuffled through their dreams   and stepped 'n' fetched a countryto write the blues with screams.I understand their meaning   it could and did derive   from living on the edge of deathThey kept my race alive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSound the flute!      Now it's mute!      Bird's delight,      Day and night,      Nightingale,      In the dale,      Lark in sky,--      Merrily, Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.       Little boy,      Full of joy;      Little girl,      Sweet and small;      Cock does crow,      So do you;      Merry voice,      Infant noise; Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.       Little lamb,      Here I am;      Come and lick      My white neck;      Let me pull      Your soft wool;      Let me kiss      Your soft face; Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow can my love hold him when the otherFlaunts a gaudy lust and is lionessTo his beast?

His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to He had no other appetite She bit him she gnawed him she sucked She wanted him complete inside her Safe and sure forever and ever Their little cries fluttered into the curtains Her eyes wanted nothing to get away Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows He gripped her hard so that life Should not drag her from that moment He wanted all future to cease He wanted to topple with his arms round her Off that moment's brink and into nothing Or everlasting or whatever there was Her embrace was an immense press To print him into her bones His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace Where the real world would never come Her smiles were spider bites So he would lie still till she felt hungry His words were occupying armies Her laughs were an assassin's attempts His looks were bullets daggers of revenge His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets His whispers were whips and jackboots Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks And their deep cries crawled over the floors Like an animal dragging a great trap His promises were the surgeon's gag Her promises took the top off his skull She would get a brooch made of it His vows pulled out all her sinews He showed her how to make a love-knot Her vows put his eyes in formalin At the back of her secret drawer Their screams stuck in the wall Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs In their dreams their brains took each other hostage In the morning they wore each other's face\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness,     Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;Conspiring with him how to load and bless     With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,     And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;          To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells     With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,And still more, later flowers for the bees,Until they think warm days will never cease,     For Summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cell.Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?     Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may findThee sitting careless on a granary floor,     Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,     Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook          Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep     Steady thy laden head across a brook;     Or by a cider-press, with patient look,          Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?     Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,---While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,     And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;Then in a wailful choir, the small gnats mourn     Among the river sallows, borne aloft          Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;     Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft     The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,          And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI must go down to the sea again, to the lonely sea and the sky;I left my shoes and socks there - I wonder if they're dry?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHold fast to dreamsFor if dreams dieLife is a broken-winged birdThat cannot fly.Hold fast to dreamsFor when dreams goLife is a barren fieldFrozen with snow.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweet dreams form a shade,O'er my lovely infants head.Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,By happy silent moony beamsSweet sleep with soft down.Weave thy brows an infant crown.Sweet sleep Angel mild,Hover o'er my happy child.Sweet smiles in the night,Hover over my delight.Sweet smiles Mothers smiles,All the livelong night beguiles.Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,Chase not slumber from thy eyes,Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,All the dovelike moans beguiles.Sleep sleep happy child,All creation slept and smil'd.Sleep sleep, happy sleep.While o'er thee thy mother weepSweet babe in thy face,Holy image I can trace.Sweet babe once like thee.Thy maker lay and wept for meWept for me for thee for all,When he was an infant small.Thou his image ever see.Heavenly face that smiles on thee,Smiles on thee on me on all,Who became an infant small,Infant smiles are His own smiles,Heaven & earth to peace beguiles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXIVIf thou must love me, let it be for noughtExcept for love's sake only. Do not say'I love her for her smile—her look—her wayOf speaking gently,—for a trick of thoughtThat falls in well with mine, and certes broughtA sense of pleasant ease on such a day'—For these things in themselves, Beloved, mayBe changed, or change for thee,—and love, so wrought,May be unwrought so. Neither love me forThine own dear pity's wiping my cheeks dry,—A creature might forget to weep, who boreThy comfort long, and lose thy love thereby!But love me for love's sake, that evermoreThou mayst love on, through love's eternity.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  ''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door-                Only this, and nothing more.'    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.    Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow    From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-                Nameless here for evermore.    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,    ''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-                This it is, and nothing more.'    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you'- here I opened wide the door;-                Darkness there, and nothing more.    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,        fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!'  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!'-                Merely this, and nothing more.    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,   Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.    'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice:    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-                'Tis the wind and nothing more.'    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and        flutter,  In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed        he;    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-                Perched, and sat, and nothing more.   Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.   'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no        craven,   Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being    Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                With such name as 'Nevermore.'    But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.    Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-    Till I scarcely more than muttered, 'other friends have flown        before-  On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'                Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'     Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store,     Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster     Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                Of 'Never- nevermore'.'    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and        door;    Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining    On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,                She shall press, ah, nevermore!    Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.    'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he        hath sent thee    Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or        devil!-  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-    On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-  Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or        devil!  By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    'Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,' I shrieked,        upstarting-  'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!    Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my        door!'               Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,    And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the        floor;  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                Shall be lifted- nevermore!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe free bird leapson the back of the windand floats downstreamtill the current endsand dips his wingsin the orange sun raysand dares to claim the sky.But a bird that stalksdown his narrow cagecan seldom see throughhis bars of ragehis wings are clipped andhis feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing.The caged bird singswith fearful trillof the things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hill for the caged birdsings of freedomThe free bird thinks of another breezeand the trade winds soft through the sighing treesand the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawnand he names the sky his own.But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreamshis shadow shouts on a nightmare screamhis wings are clipped and his feet are tiedso he opens his throat to singThe caged bird singswith a fearful trillof things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hillfor the caged birdsings of freedom.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow as I was young and easy under the apple boughsAbout the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,The night above the dingle starry,Time let me hail and climbGolden in the heydays of his eyes,And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple townsAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leavesTrail with daisies and barleyDown the rivers of the windfall light.And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barnsAbout the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,In the sun that is young once only,Time let me play and beGolden in the mercy of his means,And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calvesSang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear andcold,And the sabbath rang slowlyIn the pebbles of the holy streams.All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hayFields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it wasairAnd playing, lovely and wateryAnd fire green as grass.And nightly under the simple starsAs I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, thenightjarsFlying with the ricks, and the horsesFlashing into the dark.And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer whiteWith the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was allShining, it was Adam and maiden,The sky gathered againAnd the sun grew round that very day.So it must have been after the birth of the simple lightIn the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walkingwarmOut of the whinnying green stableOn to the fields of praise.And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay houseUnder the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,In the sun born over and over,I ran my heedless ways,My wishes raced through the house high hayAnd nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allowsIn all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songsBefore the children green and goldenFollow him out of grace.Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time wouldtake meUp to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,In the moon that is always rising,Nor that riding to sleepI should hear him fly with the high fieldsAnd wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,Time held me green and dyingThough I sang in my chains like the sea.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI caught a tremendous fishand held him beside the boathalf out of water, with my hookfast in a corner of his mouth.He didn't fight.He hadn't fought at all.He hung a grunting weight,battered and venerableand homely. Here and therehis brown skin hung in stripslike ancient wallpaper,and its pattern of darker brownwas like wallpaper:shapes like full-blown rosesstained and lost through age.He was speckled with barnacles,fine rosettes of lime,and infestedwith tiny white sea-lice,and underneath two or threerags of green weed hung down.While his gills were breathing inthe terrible oxygen- the frightening gills,fresh and crisp with blood,that can cut so badly- I thought of the coarse white fleshpacked in like feathers,the big bones and the little bones,the dramatic reds and blacksof his shiny entrails,and the pink swim-bladderlike a big peony.I looked into his eyeswhich were far larger than minebut shallower, and yellowed,the irises backed and packedwith tarnished tinfoilseen through the lensesof old scratched isinglass.They shifted a little, but notto return my stare.- It was more like the tippingof an object toward the light.I admired his sullen face,the mechanism of his jaw,and then I sawthat from his lower lip- if you could call it a lipgrim, wet, and weaponlike,hung five old pieces of fish-line,or four and a wire leaderwith the swivel still attached,with all their five big hooksgrown firmly in his mouth.A green line, frayed at the endwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,and a fine black threadstill crimped from the strain and snapwhen it broke and he got away.Like medals with their ribbonsfrayed and wavering,a five-haired beard of wisdomtrailing from his aching jaw.I stared and staredand victory filled upthe little rented boat,from the pool of bilgewhere oil had spread a rainbowaround the rusted engineto the bailer rusted orange,the sun-cracked thwarts,the oarlocks on their strings,the gunnels- until everythingwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! And I let the fish go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOh, silver tree! Oh, shining rivers of the soul! In a Harlem cabaret Six long-headed jazzers play. A dancing girl whose eyes are bold Lifts high a dress of silken gold. Oh, singing tree! Oh, shining rivers of the soul! Were Eve's eyes In the first garden Just a bit too bold? Was Cleopatra gorgeous In a gown of gold? Oh, shining tree! Oh, silver rivers of the soul! In a whirling cabaret Six long-headed jazzers play.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI marvel how Nature could ever find space For so many strange contrasts in one human face: There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom. There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain; Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease, Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease. There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds, And attention full ten times as much as there needs; Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy; And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy. There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there, There's virtue, the title it surely may claim, Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name. This picture from nature may seem to depart, Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart; And I for five centuries right gladly would be Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXIVIf thou must love me, let it be for noughtExcept for love's sake only.

So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.  There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head, That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so I said, 'Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head's bare, You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.'  And so he was quiet, and that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight! -- That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack, Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.  And by came an angel, who had a bright key, And he opened the coffins, and let them all free; Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run, And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.  Then naked and white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind; And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father, and never want joy.  And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark, And got with our bags and our brushes to work. Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm: So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   SILENT and amazed, even when a little boy,   I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his         statements,   As contending against some being or influence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd God stepped out on space,And he looked around and said:I'm lonely--I'll make me a world.And far as the eye of God could seeDarkness covered everything,Blacker than a hundred midnightsDown in a cypress swamp.Then God smiled,And the light broke,And the darkness rolled up on one side,And the light stood shining on the other,And God said: That's good!Then God reached out and took the light in his hands,And God rolled the light around in his handsUntil he made the sun;And he set that sun a-blazing in the heavens.And the light that was left from making the sunGod gathered it up in a shining ballAnd flung it against the darkness,Spangling the night with the moon and stars.Then down betweenThe darkness and the lightHe hurled the world;And God said: That's good!Then God himself stepped down--And the sun was on his right hand,And the moon was on his left;The stars were clustered about his head,And the earth was under his feet.And God walked, and where he trodHis footsteps hollowed the valleys outAnd bulged the mountains up.Then he stopped and looked and sawThat the earth was hot and barren.So God stepped over to the edge of the worldAnd he spat out the seven seas--He batted his eyes, and the lightnings flashed--He clapped his hands, and the thunders rolled--And the waters above the earth came down,The cooling waters came down.Then the green grass sprouted,And the little red flowers blossomed,The pine tree pointed his finger to the sky,And the oak spread out his arms,The lakes cuddled down in the hollows of the ground,And the rivers ran down to the sea;And God smiled again, And the rainbow appeared,And curled itself around his shoulder.Then God raised his arm and he waved his handOver the sea and over the land,And he said: Bring forth! Bring forth!And quicker than God could drop his hand,Fishes and fowlsAnd beasts and birdsSwam the rivers and the seas,Roamed the forests and the woods,And split the air with their wings.And God said: That's good!Then God walked around,And God looked aroundOn all that he had made.He looked at his sun, And he looked at his moon,And he looked at his little stars;He looked on his worldWith all its living things,And God said: I'm lonely still.Then God sat down--On the side of a hill where he could think;By a deep, wide river he sat down;With his head in his hands,God thought and thought,Till he thought: I'll make me a man!Up from the bed of the riverGod scooped the clay;And by the bank of the riverHe kneeled him down;And there the great God AlmightyWho lit the sun and fixed it in the sky, Who flung the stars to the most far corner of the night,Who rounded the earth in the middle of his hand;This great God,Like a mammy bending over her baby,Kneeled down in the dustToiling over a lump of clayTill he shaped it in is his own image;Then into it he blew the breath of life,And man became a living soul.Amen.Amen.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDid the people of Viet Namuse lanterns of stone?Did they hold ceremoniesto reverence the opening of buds?Were they inclined to quiet laughter?Did they use bone and ivory,jade and silver, for ornament?Had they an epic poem?Did they distinguish between speech and singing?Sir, their light hearts turned to stone.It is not remembered whether in gardensstone gardens illumined pleasant ways.Perhaps they gathered once to delight in blossom,but after their children were killedthere were no more buds.Sir, laughter is bitter to the burned mouth.A dream ago, perhaps. Ornament is for joy.All the bones were charred.it is not remembered. Remember,most were peasants; their lifewas in rice and bamboo.When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddiesand the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,maybe fathers told their sons old tales.When bombs smashed those mirrorsthere was time only to scream.There is an echo yetof their speech which was like a song.It was reported their singing resembled the flight of moths in moonlight.Who can say? It is silent now.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt so happens I am sick of being a man.And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie     housesdried up, waterproof, like a swan made of feltsteering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse     sobs.The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool.The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens,no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.It so happens that I am sick of my feet and my nailsand my hair and my shadow.It so happens I am sick of being a man.Still it would be marvelousto terrify a law clerk with a cut lily,or kill a nun with a blow on the ear.It would be greatto go through the streets with a green knifeletting out yells until I died of the cold.I don't want to go on being a root in the dark,insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,taking in and thinking, eating every day.I don't want so much misery.I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses,half frozen, dying of grief.That's why Monday, when it sees me comingwith my convict face, blazes up like gasoline,and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the     night.And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist     houses,into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.There are sulphur-colored birds, and hideous intestineshanging over the doors of houses that I hate,and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,there are mirrorsthat ought to have wept from shame and terror,there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical     cords.     I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes,my rage, forgetting everything,I walk by, going through office buildings and orthopedic     shops,and courtyards with washing hanging from the line:underwear, towels and shirts from which slowdirty tears are falling.Translated by Robert Bly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo the one I love, the one I adore, My only goal in life, the one I live for -Though we might fight more than we get along, I hope our relationship will never go wrong.I love to be with you, I love you around; I'm so glad I'm the one you found.Though you may not see what you mean to me, My love for you will always be.I know you love me and I know you care; That's why I treasure the love we share.I want you to know I'm here for you, Whatever it is I'll help you through.To the one I love, the one I adore, My love grows every day more and more.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey put a leather belt around her13 feet of tape and bound her Handcuffs to secure her And only God knows what else,She's illegal, so deport her Said the Empire that brought her She died, Nobody killed herAnd she never killed herself.

Here lies the extradition squad And we should all now pray to God That as they go about their job They make not one mistake, For I fear as I walk the streetsThat one day I just may meet Officials who may tie my feet And how would I escape.I see my people demonstrating And educated folks debating The way they're separating The elder from the youth, When all they are demanding Is a little overstanding They too have family planningNow their children want the truth.As I move around I am eyeing So many poets crying And so many poets trying To articulate the grief, I cannot help but wonder How the alien deporters (As they said to press reporters)Can feel absolute relief.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this book,And slowly read, and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true,But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overheadAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t              THE wild bee reels from bough to bough                With his furry coat and his gauzy wing.              Now in a lily-cup, and now                Setting a jacinth bell a-swing,                        In his wandering;              Sit closer love: it was here I trow                        I made that vow,              Swore that two lives should be like one                As long as the sea-gull loved the sea,              As long as the sunflower sought the sun,--                It shall be, I said, for eternity                        'Twixt you and me!              Dear friend, those times are over and done,                        Love's web is spun.              Look upward where the poplar trees                Sway and sway in the summer air,              Here in the valley never a breeze                Scatters the thistledown, but there                        Great winds blow fair              From the mighty murmuring mystical seas,                        And the wave-lashed leas.              Look upward where the white gull screams,                What does it see that we do not see?              Is that a star? or the lamp that gleams                On some outward voyaging argosy,--                        Ah! can it be              We have lived our lives in a land of dreams!                        How sad it seems.              Sweet, there is nothing left to say                But this, that love is never lost,              Keen winter stabs the breasts of May                Whose crimson roses burst his frost,                        Ships tempest-tossed              Will find a harbour in some bay,                        And so we may.              And there is nothing left to do                But to kiss once again, and part,              Nay, there is nothing we should rue,                I have my beauty,--you your Art,                        Nay, do not start,              One world was not enough for two                        Like me and you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe animal I really dig,Above all others is the pig.Pigs are noble. Pigs are clever,Pigs are courteous. However,Now and then, to break this rule,One meets a pig who is a fool.What, for example, would you say,If strolling through the woods one day,Right there in front of you you sawA pig who'd built his house of STRAW?The Wolf who saw it licked his lips,And said, 'That pig has had his chips.' 'Little pig, little pig, let me come in!''No, no, by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!''Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!'The little pig began to pray,But Wolfie blew his house away.He shouted, 'Bacon, pork and ham!Oh, what a lucky Wolf I am!'And though he ate the pig quite fast,He carefully kept the tail till last.Wolf wandered on, a trifle bloated.Surprise, surprise, for soon he notedAnother little house for pigs,And this one had been built of TWIGS!'Little pig, little pig, let me come in!''No, no, by the hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!''Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!'The Wolf said, 'Okay, here we go!'He then began to blow and blow.The little pig began to squeal.He cried, 'Oh Wolf, you've had one meal!Why can't we talk and make a deal?The Wolf replied, 'Not on your nelly!'And soon the pig was in his belly.'Two juicy little pigs!' Wolf cried,'But still I'm not quite satisfied!I know how full my tummy's bulging,But oh, how I adore indulging.'So creeping quietly as a mouse,The Wolf approached another house,A house which also had insideA little piggy trying to hide.'You'll not get me!' the Piggy cried.'I'll blow you down!' the Wolf replied.'You'll need,' Pig said, 'a lot of puff,And I don't think you've got enough.'Wolf huffed and puffed and blew and blew.The house stayed up as good as new. 'If I can't blow it down,' Wolf said,I'll have to blow it up instead.I'll come back in the dead of nightAnd blow it up with dynamite!'Pig cried, 'You brute! I might have known!'Then, picking up the telephone,He dialed as quickly as he couldThe number of red Riding Hood.'Hello,' she said. 'Who's speaking? Who?Oh, hello, Piggy, how d'you do?'Pig cried, 'I need your help, Miss Hood!Oh help me, please! D'you think you could?''I'll try of course,' Miss Hood replied.'What's on your mind...?' 'A Wolf!' Pig cried.'I know you've dealt with wolves before,And now I've got one at my door!''My darling Pig,' she said, 'my sweet,That's something really up my street.I've just begun to wash my hair.But when it's dry, I'll be right there.'A short while later, through the wood,Came striding brave Miss Riding Hood.The Wolf stood there, his eyes ablaze,And yellowish, like mayonnaise.His teeth were sharp, his gums were raw,And spit was dripping from his jaw.Once more the maiden's eyelid flickers.She draws the pistol from her knickers.Once more she hits the vital spot,And kills him with a single shot.Pig, peeping through the window, stoodAnd yelled, 'Well done, Miss Riding Hood!'Ah, Piglet, you must never trustYoung ladies from the upper crust.For now, Miss Riding Hood, one notes,Not only has two wolfskin coats,But when she goes from place to place,She has a PIGSKIN TRAVELING CASE.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(With compliments and apologies to all not mentioned by name)i wanta say just gotta say somethingbout those beautiful beautiful beautiful outasightblack menwith they afroswalking down the streetis the same ol dangerbut a brand new pleasuresitting on stoops, in bars, going to officesrunning numbers, watching for their whorespreaching in churches, driving their hogswalking their dogs, winking at mein their fire red, lime green, burnt orangeroyal blue tight tight pants that hugwhat i like to hugjerry butler, wilson pickett, the impressionstemptations, mighty mighty slydon't have to do anything but walkon stageand i scream and stamp and shoutsee new breed men in breed allsdashiki suits with shirts that matchthe lining that compliments the tiesthat smile at the sandalswhere dirty toes peek at meand i scream and stamp and shoutfor more beautiful beautiful beautifulblack men with outasight afros\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI note the obvious differencesin the human family.Some of us are serious,some thrive on comedy.Some declare their lives are livedas true profundity,and others claim they really livethe real reality.The variety of our skin tonescan confuse, bemuse, delight,brown and pink and beige and purple,tan and blue and white.I've sailed upon the seven seasand stopped in every land,I've seen the wonders of the worldnot yet one common man.I know ten thousand womencalled Jane and Mary Jane,but I've not seen any twowho really were the same.Mirror twins are differentalthough their features jibe,and lovers think quite different thoughtswhile lying side by side.We love and lose in China,we weep on England's moors,and laugh and moan in Guinea,and thrive on Spanish shores.We seek success in Finland,are born and die in Maine.In minor ways we differ,in major we're the same.I note the obvious differencesbetween each sort and type,but we are more alike, my friends,than we are unalike.We are more alike, my friends,than we are unalike.We are more alike, my friends,than we are unalike.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is much I oweto those I do not love.The relief in acceptingthey are closer to another.Joy that I am notthe wolf to their sheep.My peace be with themfor with them I am free,and this, love can neither give,nor know how to take.I don't wait for themfrom window to door.Almost as patientas a sun dial,I understandwhat love does not understand.I forgivewhat love would never have forgiven.Between rendezvous and letterno eternity passes,only a few days or weeks.My trips with them always turn out well.Concerts are heard.Cathedrals are toured.Landscapes are distinct.And when seven rivers and mountainscome between us,they are rivers and mountainswell known from any map.It is thanks to themthat I live in three dimensions,in a non-lyrical and non-rhetorical space,with a shifting, thus real, horizon.They don't even knowhow much they carry in their empty hands.'I don't owe them anything',love would have saidon this open topic.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tof ice. Deceptively reserved and flat,it lies 'in grandeur and in mass'beneath a sea of shifting snow-dunes;dots of cyclamen-red and maroon on its clearly definedpseudo-podiamade of glass that will bend–a much needed invention–comprising twenty-eight ice-fields from fifty to five hundredfeet thick,of unimagined delicacy.'Picking periwinkles from the cracks'or killing prey with the concentric crushing rigor of the python,it hovers forward 'spider fashionon its arms' misleading like lace;its 'ghostly pallor changingto the green metallic tinge of an anemone-starred pool.'The fir-trees, in 'the magnitude of their root systems,'rise aloof from these maneuvers 'creepy to behold,'austere specimens of our American royal families,'each like the shadow of the one beside it.The rock seems frail compared with the dark energy of life,'its vermilion and onyx and manganese-blue interior expensivenessleft at the mercy of the weather;'stained transversely by iron where the water drips down,'recognized by its plants and its animals.Completing a circle,you have been deceived into thinking that you have progressed,under the polite needles of the larches'hung to filter, not to intercept the sunlight'–met by tightly wattled spruce-twigs'conformed to an edge like clipped cypressas if no branch could penetrate the cold beyond its company';and dumps of gold and silver ore enclosing The Goat’s Mirror–that lady-fingerlike depression in the shape of the left humanfoot,which prejudices you in favor of itselfbefore you have had time to see the others;its indigo, pea-green, blue-green, and turquoise,from a hundred to two hundred feet deep,'merging in irregular patches in the middle of the lakewhere, like gusts of a stormobliterating the shadows of the fir-trees, the wind makes lanesof ripples.'What spot could have merits of equal importancefor bears, elks, deer, wolves, goats, and ducks?Pre-empted by their ancestors,this is the property of the exacting porcupine,and of the rat 'slipping along to its burrow in the swampor pausing on high ground to smell the heather';of 'thoughtful beaversmaking drains which seem the work of careful men with shovels,'and of the bears inspecting unexpectedlyant-hills and berry-bushes.Composed of calcium gems and alabaster pillars,topaz, tourmaline crystals and amethyst quartz,their den in somewhere else, concealed in the confusionof 'blue forests thrown together with marble and jasper and agateas if the whole quarries had been dynamited.'And farther up, in a stag-at-bay positionas a scintillating fragment of these terrible stalagmites,stands the goat,its eye fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fall–an endless skein swayed by the wind,immune to force of gravity in the perspective of the peaks.A special antelopeacclimated to 'grottoes from which issue penetrating draughtswhich make you wonder why you came,'it stands it groundon cliffs the color of the clouds, of petrified white vapor–black feet, eyes, nose, and horns, engraved on dazzling ice-fields,the ermine body on the crystal peak;the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene,dyeing them white–upon this antique pedestal,'a mountain with those graceful lines which prove it a volcano,'its top a complete cone like Fujiyama’still an explosion blew it off.Distinguished by a beautyof which 'the visitor dare never fully speak at homefor fear of being stoned as an impostor,'Big Snow Mountain is the home of a diversity of creatures:those who 'have lived in hotelsbut who now live in camps–who prefer to';the mountain guide evolving from the trapper,'in two pairs of trousers, the outer one older,wearing slowly away from the feet to the knees';'the nine-striped chipmunkrunning with unmammal-like agility along a log';the water ouzelwith 'its passion for rapids and high-pressured falls,'building under the arch of some tiny Niagara;the white-tailed ptarmigan 'in winter solid white,feeding on heather-bells and alpine buckwheat';and the eleven eagles of the west,'fond of the spring fragrance and the winter colors,'used to the unegoistic action of the glaciersand 'several hours of frost every midsummer night.''They make a nice appearance, don’t they,'happy see nothing?Perched on treacherous lava and pumice–those unadjusted chimney-pots and cleaverswhich stipulate 'names and addresses of persons to notifyin case of disaster'–they hear the roar of ice and supervise the waterwinding slowly through the cliffs,the road 'climbing like the threadwhich forms the groove around a snail-shell,doubling back and forth until where snow begins, it ends.'No 'deliberate wide-eyed wistfulness' is hereamong the boulders sunk in ripples and white waterwhere 'when you hear the best wild music of the forestit is sure to be a marmot,'the victim on some slight observatory,of 'a struggle between curiosity and caution,'inquiring what has scared it:a stone from the moraine descending in leaps,another marmot, or the spotted ponies with glass eyes,brought up on frosty grass and flowersand rapid draughts of ice-water.Instructed none knows how, to climb the mountain,by business men who require for recreationthree hundred and sixty-five holidays in the year,these conspicuously spotted little horses are peculiar;hard to discern among the birch-trees, ferns, and lily-pads,avalanche lilies, Indian paint-brushes,bear’s ears and kittentails,and miniature cavalcades of chlorophylless fungimagnified in profile on the moss-beds like moonstones in the water;the cavalcade of calico competing with the original American menagerie of stylesamong the white flowers of the rhododendron surmountingrigid leavesupon which moisture works its alchemy,transmuting verdure into onyx.'Like happy souls in Hell,' enjoying mental difficulties,the Greeksamused themselves with delicate behaviorbecause it was 'so noble and fair';not practised in adapting their intelligenceto eagle-traps and snow-shoes,to alpenstocks and other toys contrived by those'alive to the advantage of invigorating pleasures.'Bows, arrows, oars, and paddles, for which trees provide thewood,in new countries more eloquent than elsewhere–augmenting the assertion that, essentially humane,'the forest affords wood for dwellings and by its beautystimulates the moral vigor of its citizens.'The Greeks liked smoothness, distrusting what was backof what could not be clearly seen,resolving with benevolent conclusiveness,'complexities which still will be complexitiesas long as the world lasts';ascribing what we clumsily call happiness,to 'an accident or a quality,a spiritual substance or the soul itself,an act, a disposition, or a habit,or a habit infused, to which the soul has been persuaded,or something distinct from a habit, a power'–such power as Adam had and we are still devoid of.'Emotionally sensitive, their hearts were hard';their wisdom was remotefrom that of these odd oracles of cool official sarcasm,upon this game preservewhere 'guns, nets, seines, traps, and explosives,hired vehicles, gambling and intoxicants are prohibited;disobedient persons being summarily removedand not allowed to return without permission in writing.'It is self-evident that it is frightful to have everything afraid of one;that one must do as one is toldand eat rice, prunes, dates, raisins, hardtack, and tomatoesthis fossil flower concise without a shiver,intact when it is cut,damned for its sacrosanct remoteness–like Henry James 'damned by the public for decorum';not decorum, but restraint;it is the love of doing hard thingsthat rebuffed and wore them out–a public out of sympathywith neatness.Neatness of finish! Neatness of finish!Relentless accuracy is the nature of this octopuswith its capacity for fact.'Creeping slowly as with meditated stealth,its arms seeming to approach from all directions,'it receives one under winds that 'tear the snow to bitsand hurl it like a sandblastshearing off twigs and loose bark from the trees.'Is 'tree' the word for these things'flat on the ground like vines'?some 'bent in a half circle with branches on one sidesuggesting dust-brushes, not trees;some finding strength in union, forming little stunted groovestheir flattened mats of branches shrunk in trying to escape'from the hard mountain 'planned by ice and polished by the wind'–the white volcano with no weather side;the lightning flashing at its base,rain falling in the valleys, and snow falling on the peak–the glassy octopus symmetrically pointed,its claw cut by the avalanche'with a sound like the crack of a rifle,in a curtain of powdered snow launched like a waterfall.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonneor being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelonapartly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastianpartly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurtpartly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birchespartly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuaryit is hard to believe when I'm with you that there can be anything as stillas solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of itin the warm New York 4 o'clock light we are drifting back and forthbetween each other like a tree breathing through its spectaclesand the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paintyou suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did themI lookat you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the worldexcept possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it's in the Frickwhich thank heavens you haven't gone to yet so we can go together the first timeand the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurismjust as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase orat a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow meand what good does all the research of the Impressionists do themwhen they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sankor for that matter Marino Marini when he didn't pick the rider as carefullyas the horseit seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experiencewhich is not going to go wasted on me which is why I am telling you about it\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo you think its Stephen?Then I'd best make sureBe on the safe side as it were.Ah, theres been a mistake.

The fisherman said: Will you have her, carelessly, trailing his nets and his nerves, as though his words sanctified the purpose with which he faced himself. I saw his white bone thrash his eyes.I followed him across the sprawling sands, my mind thumping in the flesh's sling. Hope lay perhaps in burning the house I lived in.Silence gripped my sleeves; his body clawed at the frothhis old nets had only dragged up from the seas.In the flickering dark his lean-to opened like a wound.The wind was I, and the days and nights before. Palm fronds scratched my skin. Inside the shack an oil lamp splayed the hours bunched to those walls.Over and over the sticky soot crossed the space of my mind.I heard him say: My daughter, she's just turned fifteen... Feel her. I'll be back soon, your bus leaves at nine. The sky fell on me, and a father's exhausted wile.Long and lean, her years were cold as rubber. She opened her wormy legs wide. I felt the hunger there,the other one, the fish slithering, turning inside\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTell me not, in mournful numbers,Life is but an empty dream! For the soul is dead that slumbers,And things are not what they seem.Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest,Was not spoken of the soul.Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,Is our destined end or way; But to act, that each to-morrowFind us farther than to-day.Art is long, and Time is fleeting,And our hearts, though stout and brave,Still, like muffled drums, are beatingFuneral marches to the grave.In the world’s broad field of battle,In the bivouac of Life,Be not like dumb, driven cattle! Be a hero in the strife! Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead! Act,— act in the living Present! Heart within, and God o’erhead! Lives of great men all remind usWe can make our lives sublime,And, departing, leave behind usFootprints on the sands of time; Footprints, that perhaps another,Sailing o’er life’s solemn main,A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,Seeing, shall take heart again.Let us, then, be up and doing,With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing,Learn to labor and to wait.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI want to sleep the dream of the apples,to withdraw from the tumult of cemetries.I want to sleep the dream of that childwho wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.I don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood,that the putrid mouth goes on asking for water.I don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass,nor of the moon with a serpent's mouththat labors before dawn.I want to sleep awhile,awhile, a minute, a century;but all must know that I have not died;that there is a stable of gold in my lips;that I am the small friend of the West wing;that I am the intense shadows of my tears.Cover me at dawn with a veil,because dawn will throw fistfuls of ants at me,and wet with hard water my shoesso that the pincers of the scorpion slide.For I want to sleep the dream of the apples,to learn a lament that will cleanse me to earth;for I want to live with that dark childwho wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe who binds to himself a joyDoes the winged life destroy; But he who kisses the joy as it fliesLives in eternity's sun rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Houses\"—so the Wise Men tell me—\"Mansions\"!

May 1949Trans. by Randy Blasing and Mutlu Konuk (1993) \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie trackI go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minuteAnd look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it. I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.I know this house isn't haunted, and I wish it were, I do;For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two. This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside. If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paidI'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.I'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to beAnd I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free. Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.But there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and loneFor the lack of something within it that it has never known. But a house that has done what a house should do,  a house that has sheltered life,That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet. So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie trackI never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeloveds, now we know that we know nothingNow that our bright and shining star can slip away from our fingertips like a puff of summer windWithout notice, our dear love can escape our doting embraceSing our songs among the stars and and walk our dances across the face of the moonIn the instant we learn that Michael is gone we know nothingNo clocks can tell our time and no oceans can rush our tidesWith the abrupt absence of our treasureThough we our many, each of us is achingly alonePiercingly aloneOnly when we confess our confusion can we remember that he was a gift to us and we did have himHe came to us from the Creator, trailing creativity in abundanceDespite the anguish of life he was sheathed in mother love and family love and survived and did more than thatHe thrived with passion and compassion, humor and styleWe had himWhether we knew who he was or did not know, he was ours and we were hisWe had himBeautiful, delighting our eyesHe raked his hat slant over his brow and took a pose on his toes for all of us and we laughed and stomped our feet for himWe were enchanted with his passion because he held nothingHe gave us all he had been givenToday in Tokyo, beneath the Eiffel Tower, in Ghana's Blackstar Square, in Johannesburg, in Pittsburgh, in Birmingham, Alabama and Birmingham England, we are missing Michael JacksonBut we do know that we had himAnd we are the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI want to sleep the dream of the apples,to withdraw from the tumult of cemetries.I want to sleep the dream of that childwho wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.I don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood,that the putrid mouth goes on asking for water.I don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass,nor of the moon with a serpent's mouththat labors before dawn.I want to sleep awhile,awhile, a minute, a century;but all must know that I have not died;that there is a stable of gold in my lips;that I am the small friend of the West wing;that I am the intense shadows of my tears.Cover me at dawn with a veil,because dawn will throw fistfuls of ants at me,and wet with hard water my shoesso that the pincers of the scorpion slide.For I want to sleep the dream of the apples,to learn a lament that will cleanse me to earth;for I want to live with that dark childwho wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeautiful is the 'thank you'Wrapped with gratitude, Offered to peace prone peopleWho go out of their way To nurse shrapnel scalded victimsAmidst napalm drugged air, Carrying their humanity, quietlyAnd humbly, in our Blood stained, greed diseased, Hate eaten world.Beautiful is the momentwhen sunlit world fades away And with it mind made mirror While look inward drawn, sight insight led, Consciousness expands endlessly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI sat all morning in the college sick bayCounting bells knelling classes to a close.At two o'clock our neighbors drove me home.In the porch I met my father crying--He had always taken funerals in his stride--And Big Jim Evans saying it was a hard blow.The baby cooed and laughed and rocked the pramWhen I came in, and I was embarrassedBy old men standing up to shake my handAnd tell me they were 'sorry for my trouble,'Whispers informed strangers I was the eldest,Away at school, as my mother held my handIn hers and coughed out angry tearless sighs.At ten o'clock the ambulance arrivedWith the corpse, stanched and bandaged by the nurses.Next morning I went up into the room. SnowdropsAnd candles soothed the bedside; I saw himFor the first time in six weeks. Paler now,Wearing a poppy bruise on his left temple,He lay in the four foot box as in his cot.No gaudy scars, the bumper knocked him clear.A four foot box, a foot for every year.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll those times I was boredout of my mind. Holding the logwhile he sawed it. Holdingthe string while he measured, boards,distances between things, or poundedstakes into the ground for rows and rowsof lettuces and beets, which I then (bored)weeded. Or sat in the backof the car, or sat still in boats,sat, sat, while at the prow, stern, wheelhe drove, steered, paddled. Itwasn't even boredom, it was looking,looking hard and up close at the smalldetails. Myopia. The worn gunwales,the intricate twill of the seatcover. The acid crumbs of loam, the granularpink rock, its igneous veins, the sea-fansof dry moss, the blackish and then the grayingbristles on the back of his neck.Sometimes he would whistle, sometimesI would. The boring rhythm of doingthings over and over, carryingthe wood, dryingthe dishes. Such minutiae. It's whatthe animals spend most of their time at,ferrying the sand, grain by grain, from their tunnels,shuffling the leaves in their burrows. He pointedsuch things out, and I would lookat the whorled texture of his square finger, earth underthe nail. Why do I remember it as sunnierall the time then, although it more oftenrained, and more birdsong?I could hardly wait to getthe hell out of there toanywhere else. Perhaps thoughboredom is happier. It is for dogs orgroundhogs. Now I wouldn't be bored.Now I would know too much.Now I would know.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough every nook and every crannyThe wind blew in on poor old GrannyAround her knees, into each ear(And up nose as well, I fear)All through the night the wind grew worseIt nearly made the vicar curseThe top had fallen off the steepleJust missing him (and other people)It blew on man, it blew on beastIt blew on nun, it blew on priestIt blew the wig off Auntie Fanny-But most of all, it blew on Granny!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeing a fatherIs quite a bother.You are as free as airWith time to spare,You're a fiscal rocketWith change in your pocket,And then one mornA child is born.Your life has been runcible,Irresponsible,Like an arrow or javelinYou've been constantly travelin'.But mostly, I daresay,Without a chaise percée,To which by comparisonNothing's embarison.But all children matures,Maybe even yours.You improve them mentallyAnd straighten them dentally,They grow tall as a lancerAnd ask questions you can't answer,And supply you with dataAbout how everybody else wears lipstick sooner and stays up later,And if they are popular,The phone they monopular.They scorn the dominionOf their parent's opinion,They're no longer corralableOnce they find that you're fallibleBut after you've raised them and educated them and gowned them,They just take their little fingers and wrap you around them.Being a father Is quite a bother,But I like it, rather.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLie down lass, with me, in sage green meadowsYour blouse flouncing open, in the teasing breezeThe meadows, feel so cotton, this time of yearCome lay beside me lass, and sense the softnessOpen field, sweet honeysuckle....arouses my yen  For passion 'neath th' sparkle by th' mid-noon sun No clouds abide our scape of choice, to pleasureAn', again I ask you lass, come lay you down by meCome close my love...these hungry emerald eyesBeg to stare into your warm, black diamond eyesTake my hand in bond, my lov', as I assure you   That emeralds and diamonds....never fade away\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll round me are words, and words and words,They grow on me like leaves, they neverSeem to stop their slow growingFrom within... But I tell my self, wordsAre a nuisance, beware of them, theyCan be so many things, aChasm where running feet must pause, toLook, a sea with paralyzing waves,A blast of burning air or,A knife most willing to cut your bestFriend's throat... Words are a nuisance, but.They grow on me like leaves ona tree,They never seem to stop their coming,From a silence, somewhere deep within...\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have known the inexorable sadness of pencils,Neat in their boxes, dolor of pad and paper weight,All the misery of manilla folders and mucilage,Desolation in immaculate public places,Lonely reception room, lavatory, switchboard,The unalterable pathos of basin and pitcher,Ritual of multigraph, paper-clip, comma,Endless duplicaton of lives and objects.And I have seen dust from the walls of institutions,Finer than flour, alive, more dangerous than silica,Sift, almost invisible, through long afternoons of tedium,Dropping a fine film on nails and delicate eyebrows,Glazing the pale hair, the duplicate grey standard faces.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you turn the cornerAnd you run into yourselfThen you know that you have turnedAll the corners that are left\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe are not lovers because of the love we make but the love we haveWe are not friends because of the laughs we spend but the tears we saveI don't want to be near you for the thoughts we share but the words we never have to speakI will never miss you because of what we do but what we are together\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Rock, A River, A TreeHosts to species long since departed,Mark the mastodon.The dinosaur, who left dry tokensOf their sojourn hereOn our planet floor,Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doomIs lost in the gloom of dust and ages.But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,Come, you may stand upon myBack and face your distant destiny,But seek no haven in my shadow.I will give you no hiding place down here.You, created only a little lower thanThe angels, have crouched too long inThe bruising darkness,Have lain too longFace down in ignorance.Your mouths spelling wordsArmed for slaughter.The rock cries out today, you may stand on me,But do not hide your face.Across the wall of the world,A river sings a beautiful song,Come rest here by my side.Each of you a bordered country,Delicate and strangely made proud,Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.Your armed struggles for profitHave left collars of waste uponMy shore, currents of debris upon my breast.Yet, today I call you to my riverside,If you will study war no more.Come, clad in peace and I will sing the songsThe Creator gave to me when IAnd the tree and stone were one.Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your browAnd when you yet knew you still knew nothing.The river sings and sings on.There is a true yearning to respond toThe singing river and the wise rock.So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew,The African and Native American, the Sioux,The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek,The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheikh,The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,The privileged, the homeless, the teacher.They hear. They all hearThe speaking of the tree.Today, the first and last of every treeSpeaks to humankind. Come to me, here beside the river.Plant yourself beside me, here beside the river.Each of you, descendant of some passed onTraveller, has been paid for.You, who gave me my first name,You Pawnee, Apache and Seneca,You Cherokee Nation, who rested with me,Then forced on bloody feet,Left me to the employment of other seekers- Desperate for gain, starving for gold.You, the Turk, the Swede, the German, the Scot...You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru,Bought, sold, stolen, arriving on a nightmarePraying for a dream.Here, root yourselves beside me.I am the tree planted by the river,Which will not be moved.I, the rock, I the river, I the treeI am yours- your passages have been paid.Lift up your faces, you have a piercing needFor this bright morning dawning for you.History, despite its wrenching pain,Cannot be unlived, and if faced with courage,Need not be lived again.Lift up your eyes uponThe day breaking for you.Give birth againTo the dream.Women, children, men,Take it into the palms of your hands.Mold it into the shape of your mostPrivate need. Sculpt it intoThe image of your most public self.Lift up your hearts.Each new hour holds new chancesFor new beginnings.Do not be wedded foreverTo fear, yoked eternallyTo brutishness.The horizon leans forward,Offering you space to place new steps of change.Here, on the pulse of this fine dayYou may have the courageTo look up and out upon me,The rock, the river, the tree, your country.No less to Midas than the mendicant.No less to you now than the mastodon then.Here on the pulse of this new dayYou may have the grace to look up and outAnd into your sister's eyes,Into your brother's face, your countryAnd say simplyVery simplyWith hopeGood morning.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweet dreams, form a shade O'er my lovely infant's head! Sweet dreams of pleasant streams By happy, silent, moony beams!  Sweet Sleep, with soft down Weave thy brows an infant crown Sweet Sleep, angel mild, Hover o'er my happy child!  Sweet smiles, in the night Hover over my delight! Sweet smiles, mother's smile, All the livelong night beguile.  Sweet moans, dovelike sighs, Chase not slumber from thine eyes! Sweet moan, sweeter smile, All the dovelike moans beguile.  Sleep, sleep, happy child! All creation slept and smiled. Sleep, sleep, happy sleep, While o'er thee doth mother weep.  Sweet babe, in thy face Holy image I can trace; Sweet babe, once like thee Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:  Wept for me, for thee, for all, When He was an infant small. Thou His image ever see, Heavenly face that smiles on thee!  Smiles on thee, on me, on all, Who became an infant small; Infant smiles are his own smiles; Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere is a long and silent street.I walk in blackness and I stumble and falland rise, and I walk blind, my feettrampling the silent stones and the dry leaves.Someone behind me also tramples, stones, leaves:if I slow down, he slows;if I run, he runs I turn : nobody.Everything dark and doorless,only my steps aware of me,I turning and turning among these cornerswhich lead forever to the streetwhere nobody waits for, nobody follows me,where I pursue a man who stumblesand rises and says when he sees me : nobody.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,But still lies pointed as it plowed the dust.If we who sight along it round the world,See nothing worthy to have been its mark,It is because like men we look too near,Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,Our missiles always make too short an arc.They fall, they rip the grass, they intersectThe curve of earth, and striking, break their own; They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.But this we know, the obstacle that checkedAnd tripped the body, shot the spirit onFurther than target ever showed or shone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe talks, turning a sun-stainedCheek to me, his mouth, a darkCavern, where stalactites ofUneven teeth gleam, his rightHand on my knee, while our mindsAre willed to race towards love;But, they only wander, trippingIdly over puddles ofDesire. .... .Can this man withNimble finger-tips unleashNothing more alive than theSkin's lazy hungers? Who canHelp us who have lived so longAnd have failed in love? The heart,An empty cistern, waitingThrough long hours, fills itselfWith coiling snakes of silence. .....I am a freak.

Or shall it come to beThe blood of paradise? And shall the earthSeem all of paradise that we shall know?The sky will be much friendlier then than now,A part of labor and a part of pain,And next in glory to enduring love,Not this dividing and indifferent blue.4She says, 'I am content when wakened birds,Before they fly, test the reality Of misty fields, by their sweet questionings;But when the birds are gone, and their warm fieldsReturn no more, where, then, is paradise?'There is not any haunt of prophecy,Nor any old chimera of the grave,Neither the golden underground, nor isleMelodious, where spirits gat them home,Nor visionary south, nor cloudy palmRemote on heaven's hill, that has enduredAs April's green endures; or will endureLike her remembrance of awakened birds,Or her desire for June and evening, tippedBy the consummation of the swallow's wings.5She says, 'But in contentment I still feelThe need of some imperishable bliss.'Death is the mother of beauty; hence from her,Alone, shall come fulfillment to our dreamsAnd our desires. Although she strews the leavesOf sure obliteration on our paths,The path sick sorrow took, the many pathsWhere triumph rang its brassy phrase, or loveWhispered a little out of tenderness,She makes the willow shiver in the sunFor maidens who were wont to sit and gazeUpon the grass, relinquished to their feet.She causes boys to pile new plums and pearsOn disregarded plate. The maidens tasteAnd stray impassioned in the littering leaves.6Is there no change of death in paradise?Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughsHang always heavy in that perfect sky,Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth,With rivers like our own that seek for seasThey never find, the same receding shoresThat never touch with inarticulate pang?Why set pear upon those river-banksOr spice the shores with odors of the plum?Alas, that they should wear our colors there,The silken weavings of our afternoons,And pick the strings of our insipid lutes!Death is the mother of beauty, mystical,Within whose burning bosom we deviseOur earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly.7Supple and turbulent, a ring of menShall chant in orgy on a summer mornTheir boisterous devotion to the sun,Not as a god, but as a god might be,Naked among them, like a savage source.Their chant shall be a chant of paradise,Out of their blood, returning to the sky;And in their chant shall enter, voice by voice,The windy lake wherein their lord delights,The trees, like serafin, and echoing hills,That choir among themselves long afterward.They shall know well the heavenly fellowshipOf men that perish and of summer morn.And whence they came and whither they shall goThe dew upon their feet shall manifest.8She hears, upon that water without sound,A voice that cries, 'The tomb in PalestineIs not the porch of spirits lingering.It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay.'We live in an old chaos of the sun,Or old dependency of day and night,Or island solitude, unsponsored, free,Of that wide water, inescapable.Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quailWhistle about us their spontaneous cries;Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness;And, in the isolation of the sky,At evening, casual flocks of pigeons makeAmbiguous undulations as they sink,Downward to darkness, on extended wings.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnly dumb guys fight.If I wasn't dumbI wouldn't be fightin'.I could make six dollars a dayOn the docksAnd I'd save more than I do now.Only dumb guys fight.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI.Let's contend no more, Love,  Strive nor weep:All be as before, Love,  ---Only sleep!\tII.What so wild as words are?  I and thouIn debate, as birds are,  Hawk on bough!\tIII.See the creature stalking  While we speak!Hush and hide the talking,  Cheek on cheek!\tIV.What so false as truth is,  False to thee?Where the serpent's tooth is  Shun the tree---\tV.Where the apple reddens  Never pry---Lest we lose our Edens,  Eve and I.\tVI.Be a god and hold me  With a charm!Be a man and fold me  With thine arm!\tVII.Teach me, only teach, Love  As I oughtI will speak thy speech, Love,  Think thy thought---\tVIII.Meet, if thou require it,  Both demands,Laying flesh and spirit  In thy hands.\tIX.That shall be to-morrow  Not to-night:I must bury sorrow  Out of sight:\tX---Must a little weep, Love,  (Foolish me!)And so fall asleep, Love,  Loved by thee.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow close the windows and hush all the fields:If the trees must, let them silently toss;No bird is singing now, and if there is,Be it my loss.It will be long ere the marshes resume,I will be long ere the earliest bird:So close the windows and not hear the wind,But see all wind-stirred.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England's mountains green?And was the holy Lamb of GodOn England's pleasant pastures seen?

Rather, instantlyRenew thy presence; as a strong tree should,Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,And let these bands of greenery which insphere theeDrop heavily down,—burst, shattered, everywhere!Because, in this deep joy to see and hear theeAnd breathe within thy shadow a new air,I do not think of thee—I am too near thee.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShe lay, skin down in the moist dirt, the canebrake rustling with the whispers of leaves, and loud longing of hounds and the ransack of hunters crackling the near branches.She muttered, lifting her head a nod toward freedom, I shall not, I shall not be moved.She gathered her babies, their tears slick as oil on black faces, their young eyes canvassing mornings of madness. Momma, is Master going to sell you from us tomorrow?Yes. Unless you keep walking more and talking less. Yes. Unless the keeper of our lives releases me from all commandments. Yes. And your lives, never mine to live, will be executed upon the killing floor of innocents. Unless you match my heart and words, saying with me,I shall not be moved.In Virginia tobacco fields, leaning into the curve of Steinway pianos, along Arkansas roads, in the red hills of Georgia, into the palms of her chained hands, she cried against calamity, You have tried to destroy me and though I perish daily,I shall not be moved.Her universe, often summarized into one black body falling finally from the tree to her feet, made her cry each time into a new voice. All my past hastens to defeat, and strangers claim the glory of my love, Iniquity has bound me to his bed.yet, I must not be moved.She heard the names, swirling ribbons in the wind of history: nigger, nigger bitch, heifer, mammy, property, creature, ape, baboon, whore, hot tail, thing, it. She said, But my description cannot fit your tongue, for I have a certain way of being in this world,and I shall not, I shall not be moved.No angel stretched protecting wings above the heads of her children, fluttering and urging the winds of reason into the confusions of their lives.

She searched God's face. Assured, she placed her fire of service on the altar, and though clothed in the finery of faith, when she appeared at the temple door, no sign welcomed Black Grandmother, Enter here.Into the crashing sound, into wickedness, she cried, No one, no, nor no one million ones dare deny me God, I go forth along, and stand as ten thousand.The Divine upon my right impels me to pull forever at the latch on Freedom's gate.The Holy Spirit upon my left leads my feet without ceasing into the camp of the righteous and into the tents of the free.These momma faces, lemon-yellow, plum-purple, honey-brown, have grimaced and twisted down a pyramid for years.

In the Welfare line, reduced to the pity of handouts. Ordained in the pulpit, shielded by the mysteries. In the operating room, husbanding life. In the choir loft, holding God in her throat. On lonely street corners, hawking her body. In the classroom, loving the children to understanding.Centered on the world's stage, she sings to her loves and beloveds, to her foes and detractors: However I am perceived and deceived, however my ignorance and conceits, lay aside your fears that I will be undone,for I shall not be moved.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy old man's a white old manAnd my old mother's black.If ever I cursed my white old manI take my curses back.If ever I cursed my black old motherAnd wished she were in hell,I'm sorry for that evil wishAnd now I wish her wellMy old man died in a fine big house.My ma died in a shack.I wonder where I'm going to die,Being neither white nor black?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI must go down to the sea again, to the lonely sea and the sky;I left my shoes and socks there - I wonder if they're dry?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRemember me when I am gone away,         Gone far away into the silent land;         When you can no more hold me by the hand,     Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.

Too proud to bend Too poor to break, I laugh until my stomach ache, When I think about myself.My folks can make me split my side, I laughed so hard I nearly died, The tales they tell, sound just like lying, They grow the fruit, But eat the rind, I laugh until I start to crying, When I think about my folks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe people I love the bestjump into work head firstwithout dallying in the shallowsand swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.They seem to become natives of that element,the black sleek heads of sealsbouncing like half-submerged balls.I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,who do what has to be done, again and again.I want to be with people who submergein the task, who go into the fields to harvestand work in a row and pass the bags along,who are not parlor generals and field desertersbut move in a common rhythmwhen the food must come in or the fire be put out.The work of the world is common as mud.Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.But the thing worth doing well donehas a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.Greek amphoras for wine or oil, Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museumsbut you know they were made to be used.

Fear no more the frown of the great, Thou art past the tyrant's stroke: Care no more to clothe and eat; To thee the reed is as the oak: The sceptre, learning, physic, must All follow this, and come to dust. Fear no more the lightning-flash, Nor the all-dread thunder-stone; Fear not slander, censure rash; Thou hast finished joy and moan; All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee, and come to dust.

Thou dirgeOf the dying year, to which this closing nightWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,Vaulted with all thy congregated mightOf vapors, from whose solid atmosphereBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh, hear!IIIThou who didst waken from his summer dreamsThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,And saw in sleep old palaces and towersQuivering within the wave's intenser day,All overgrown with azure moss and flowersSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! ThouFor whose path the Atlantic's level powersCleave themselves into chasms, while far belowThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wearThe sapless foliage of the ocean, knowThy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,And tremble and despoil themselves: oh, hear!IVIf I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;A wave to pant beneath thy power, and shareThe impulse of thy strength, only less freeThan thou, O uncontrollable! If evenI were as in my boyhood, and could beThe comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speedScarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have strivenAs thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowedOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.VMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:What if my leaves are falling like its own!The tumult of thy mighty harmoniesWill take from both a deep, autumnal tone,Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!Drive my dead thoughts over the universeLike withered leaves to quicken a new birth!And, by the incantation of this verse,Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearthAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!Be through my lips to unawakened earthThe trumpet of a prophecy!

He pointed backwardOver his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,'You can just see it glancing off the roofMaking a great scroll upward toward the sky,Long enough for recording all our names on.-I think I'll just call up my wife and tell herI'm here-so far-and starting on again.I'll call her softly so that if she's wiseAnd gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer.'Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened.'Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I'm at Cole's. I'm late.I called you up to say Good-night from hereBefore I went to say Good-morning there.-I thought I would.- I know, but, Lett-I know-I could, but what's the sense? The rest won't beSo bad.- Give me an hour for it.- Ho, ho,Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;The rest is down.- Why no, no, not a wallow:They kept their heads and took their time to itLike darlings, both of them. They're in the barn.-My dear, I'm coming just the same. I didn'tCall you to ask you to invite me home.-'He lingered for some word she wouldn't say,Said it at last himself, 'Good-night,' and then,Getting no answer, closed the telephone.The three stood in the lamplight round the tableWith lowered eyes a moment till he said,'I'll just see how the horses are.''Yes, do,'Both the Coles said together. Mrs. ColeAdded: 'You can judge better after seeing.-I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,Brother Meserve. You know to find your wayOut through the shed.''I guess I know my way,I guess I know where I can find my nameCarved in the shed to tell me who I amIf it don't tell me where I am. I usedTo play-''You tend your horses and come back.Fred Cole, you're going to let him!''Well, aren't you?How can you help yourself?''I called him Brother.Why did I call him that?''It's right enough.That's all you ever heard him called round here.He seems to have lost off his Christian name.''Christian enough I should call that myself.He took no notice, did he? Well, at leastI didn't use it out of love of him,The dear knows. I detest the thought of himWith his ten children under ten years old.I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,All's ever I heard of it, which isn't much.But that's not saying-Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve,Isn't it, now? He's been here half an hour.He says he left the village store at nine.Three hours to do four miles-a mile an hourOr not much better. Why, it doesn't seemAs if a man could move that slow and move.Try to think what he did with all that time.And three miles more to go!''Don't let him go.Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you.That sort of man talks straight on all his lifeFrom the last thing he said himself, stone deafTo anything anyone else may say.I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you.''What is he doing out a night like this?Why can't he stay at home?''He had to preach.''It's no night to be out.''He may be small,He may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough.''And strong of stale tobacco.''He'll pull through.''You only say so. Not another houseOr shelter to put into from this placeTo theirs. I'm going to call his wife again.''Wait and he may. Let's see what he will do.Let's see if he will think of her again.But then I doubt he's thinking of himselfHe doesn't look on it as anything.''He shan't go-there!''It is a night, my dear.''One thing: he didn't drag God into it.''He don't consider it a case for God.''You think so, do you? You don't know the kind.He's getting up a miracle this minute.Privately-to himself, right now, he's thinkingHe'll make a case of it if he succeeds,But keep still if he fails.''Keep still all over.He'll be dead-dead and buried.''Such a trouble!Not but I've every reason not to careWhat happens to him if it only takesSome of the sanctimonious conceitOut of one of those pious scalawags.''Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe.''You like the runt.''Don't you a little?''Well,I don't like what he's doing, which is whatYou like, and like him for.''Oh, yes you do.You like your fun as well as anyone;Only you women have to put these airs onTo impress men. You've got us so ashamedOf being men we can't look at a good fightBetween two boys and not feel bound to stop it.Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.-He's here. I leave him all to you. Go inAnd save his life.- All right, come in, Meserve.Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?''Fine, fine.''And ready for some more? My wife hereSays it won't do. You've got to give it up.''Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to your wife.What did your wife say on the telephone?'Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lampOr something not far from it on the table.By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,He pointed with his hand from where it layLike a white crumpled spider on his knee:'That leaf there in your open book! It movedJust then, I thought. It's stood erect like that,There on the table, ever since I came,Trying to turn itself backward or forward,I've had my eye on it to make out which;If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience-You see I know-to get you on to thingsIt wants to see how you will take, if backwardIt's from regret for something you have passedAnd failed to see the good of. Never mind,Things must expect to come in front of usA many times-I don't say just how many-That varies with the things-before we see them.One of the lies would make it out that nothingEver presents itself before us twice.Where would we be at last if that were so?Our very life depends on everything'sRecurring till we answer from within.The thousandth time may prove the charm.- That leaf!It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.But the wind didn't move it if it moved.It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.It couldn't stir so sensitively poisedA thing as that. It couldn't reach the lampTo get a puff of black smoke from the flame,Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.You make a little foursquare block of air,Quiet and light and warm, in spite of allThe illimitable dark and cold and storm,And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;Though for all anyone can tell, reposeMay be the thing you haven't, yet you give it.So false it is that what we haven't we can't give;So false, that what we always say is true.I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?''I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,But if you're going- Say you'll stay, you know?But let me raise this curtain on a scene,And show you how it's piling up against you.You see the snow-white through the white of frost?Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbedSince last we read the gage.''It looks as ifSome pallid thing had squashed its features flatAnd its eyes shut with overeagernessTo see what people found so interestingIn one another, and had gone to sleepOf its own stupid lack of understanding,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuffShort off, and died against the window-pane.''Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourselfMore than you will us with such nightmare talk.It's you it matters to, because it's youWho have to go out into it alone.''Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay.''Before you drop the curtain-I'm reminded:You recollect the boy who came out hereTo breathe the air one winter-had a roomDown at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morningAfter a downy storm, he passed our placeAnd found me banking up the house with snow.And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,Piling it well above the window-sills.The snow against the window caught his eye.'Hey, that's a pretty thought'-those were his words.'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.You can't get too much winter in the winter.'Those were his words. And he went home and allBut banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.Now you and I would go to no such length.At the same time you can't deny it makesIt not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,Playing our fancy, to have the snowline runSo high across the pane outside. There whereThere is a sort of tunnel in the frostMore like a tunnel than a hole-way downAt the far end of it you see a stirAnd quiver like the frayed edge of the driftBlown in the wind. I like that-I like that.Well, now I leave you, people.''Come, Meserve,We thought you were deciding not to go-The ways you found to say the praise of comfortAnd being where you are. You want to stay.''I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.This house is frozen brittle, all exceptThis room you sit in. If you think the windSounds further off, it's not because it's dying;You're further under in the snow-that's all-And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dustIt bursts against us at the chimney mouth,And at the eaves. I like it from insideMore than I shall out in it. But the horsesAre rested and it's time to say good-night,And let you get to bed again. Good-night,Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.''Lucky for you you did. Lucky for youYou had us for a half-way stationTo stop at. If you were the kind of manPaid heed to women, you'd take my adviceAnd for your family's sake stay where you are.But what good is my saying it over and over?You've done more than you had a right to thinkYou could do-now. You know the risk you takeIn going on.''Our snow-storms as a ruleAren't looked on as man-killers, and althoughI'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleepUnder it all, his door sealed up and lost,Than the man fighting it to keep above it,Yet think of the small birds at roost and notIn nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?Their bulk in water would be frozen rockIn no time out to-night. And yet to-morrowThey will come budding boughs from tree to treeFlirting their wings and saying Chickadee,As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.''But why when no one wants you to go on?Your wife-she doesn't want you to. We don't,And you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?''Save us from being cornered by a woman.Well, there's'-She told Fred afterward that inThe pause right there, she thought the dreaded wordWas coming, 'God.' But no, he only said'Well, there's-the storm. That says I must go on.That wants me as a war might if it came.Ask any man.'He threw her that as somethingTo last her till he got outside the door.He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.When Cole returned he found his wife still standingBeside the table near the open book,Not reading it.'Well, what kind of a manDo you call that?' she said.'He had the giftOf words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?''Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?''Or disregarding people's civil questions-What? We've found out in one hour more about himThan we had seeing him pass by in the roadA thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!You didn't think you'd keep him after all.Oh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave youMuch say in the matter, and I'm just as gladWe're not in for a night of him. No sleepIf he had stayed. The least thing set him going.It's quiet as an empty church without him.''But how much better off are we as it is?We'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.''Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't.He knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try.Get into bed I say, and get some rest.He won't come back, and if he telephones,It won't be for an hour or two.''Well then- We can't be any help by sitting hereAnd living his fight through with him, I suppose.'- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Cole had been telephoning in the dark.Mrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:'Did she call you or you call her?''She me.You'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.We must have been asleep: it's three and after.''Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper.I want to speak to her.''All she said was,He hadn't come and had he really started.''She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.''He had the shovel. He'll have made a fight.''Why did I ever let him leave this house!''Don't begin that. You did the best you couldTo keep him-though perhaps you didn't quiteConceal a wish to see him show the spunkTo disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you.''Fred, after all I said! You shan't make outThat it was any way but what it was.Did she let on by any word she saidShe didn't thank me?''When I told her 'Gone,''Well then,' she said, and 'Well then'-like a threat.And then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you,Why did you let him go'?''Asked why we let him?You let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.She didn't dare to speak when he was here.Their number's-twenty-one? The thing won't work.Someone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles.The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!It's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and gone.''Try speaking. Say 'Hello'!''Hello. Hello.''What do you hear?''I hear an empty room-You know-it sounds that way. And yes, I hear-I think I hear a clock-and windows rattling.No step though. If she's there she's sitting down.''Shout, she may hear you.''Shouting is no good.''Keep speaking then.''Hello. Hello. Hello.You don't suppose-? She wouldn't go out doors?''I'm half afraid that's just what she might do.''And leave the children?''Wait and call again.You can't hear whether she has left the doorWide open and the wind's blown out the lampAnd the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?''One of two things, either she's gone to bedOr gone out doors.''In which case both are lost.Do you know what she's like? Have you ever met her?It's strange she doesn't want to speak to us.''Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.''A clock maybe.''Don't you hear something else?''Not talking.''No.''Why, yes, I hear-what is it?''What do you say it is?''A baby's crying!Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.''Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,Not if she's there.''What do you make of it?''There's only one thing possible to make,That is, assuming-that she has gone out.Of course she hasn't though.' They both sat downHelpless. 'There's nothing we can do till morning.''Fred, I shan't let you think of going out.''Hold on.' The double bell began to chirp.They started up. Fred took the telephone.'Hello, Meserve. You're there, then!-And your wife?Good! Why I asked-she didn't seem to answer.He says she went to let him in the barn.-We're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.Drop in and see us when you're passing.''Well,She has him then, though what she wants him forI don't see.''Possibly not for herself.Maybe she only wants him for the children.''The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.What did he come in for?-To talk and visit?Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.If he thinks he is going to make our houseA halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere- ''I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned.''You think you haven't been concerned yourself.''If you mean he was inconsiderateTo rout us out to think for him at midnightAnd then take our advice no more than nothing,Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him.We've had a share in one night of his life.What'll you bet he ever calls again?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSo we'll go no more a-roving    So late into the night, Though the heart still be as loving,    And the moon still be as bright. For the sword outwears its sheath,    And the soul outwears the breast, And the heart must pause to breathe,    And love itself have rest.

They presumeTo say which buds are leaf and which are bloom.A feather-hammer gives a double knock.This Eden day is done at two o'clock.An hour of winter day might seem too shortTo make it worth life's while to wake and sport.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,    Thy tribute wave deliver:No more by thee my steps shall be,    For ever and for ever.Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,    A rivulet then a river:Nowhere by thee my steps shall be    For ever and for ever.But here will sigh thine alder tree    And here thine aspen shiver;And here by thee will hum the bee,    For ever and for ever.A thousand suns will stream on thee,    A thousand moons will quiver;But not by thee my steps shall be,    For ever and for ever.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOut of the church she followed them  With a lofty step and mien: His bride was like a village maid,   Maude Clare was like a queen.“Son Thomas, ” his lady mother said,   With smiles, almost with tears: “May Nell and you but live as true  As we have done for years; “Your father thirty years ago    Had just your tale to tell; But he was not so pale as you,   Nor I so pale as Nell.”My lord was pale with inward strife,   And Nell was pale with pride; My lord gazed long on pale Maude Clare  Or ever he kissed the bride.“Lo, I have brought my gift, my lord,     Have brought my gift, ” she said: To bless the hearth, to bless the board,    To bless the marriage-bed.“Here’s my half of the golden chain  You wore about your neck, That day we waded ankle-deep  For lilies in the beck: “Here’s my half of the faded leaves    We plucked from the budding bough, With feet amongst the lily leaves, -  The lilies are budding now.”He strove to match her scorn with scorn,   He faltered in his place: “Lady, ” he said, - “Maude Clare, ” he said, -  “Maude Clare, ” – and hid his face.She turn’d to Nell: “My Lady Nell,   I have a gift for you; Though, were it fruit, the blooms were gone,   Or, were it flowers, the dew.“Take my share of a fickle heart,     Mine of a paltry love: Take it or leave it as you will,     I wash my hands thereof.”“And what you leave, ” said Nell, “I’ll take,     And what you spurn, I’ll wear; For he’s my lord for better and worse,    And him I love Maude Clare.“Yea, though you’re taller by the head,   More wise and much more fair: I’ll love him till he loves me best,   Me best of all Maude Clare.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHey diddle diddleWe're all on the fiddleAnd never get up until noon.We only take cashWhich we carefully stashAnd we work by the light of the moon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are holes in the skyWhere the rain gets inBut there ever so smallThat's why the rain is thin.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOh, but it is dirty!--this little filling station,oil-soaked, oil-permeatedto a disturbing, over-allblack translucency.Be careful with that match!Father wears a dirty,oil-soaked monkey suitthat cuts him under the arms,and several quick and saucyand greasy sons assist him(it's a family filling station),all quite thoroughly dirty.Do they live in the station?It has a cement porchbehind the pumps, and on ita set of crushed and grease-impregnated wickerwork;on the wicker sofaa dirty dog, quite comfy.Some comic books providethe only note of color--of certain color.

In yourself you stretch, you are well. You look at things Through his eyes. A cardinal is red. A sky is blue. Suddenly you know he knows too. He is not there but You know you are tasting together The winter, or a light spring weather. His hand to take your hand is overmuch. Too much to bear. You cannot look in his eyes Because your pulse must not say What must not be said. When he Shuts a door- Is not there_ Your arms are water. And you are free With a ghastly freedom. You are the beautiful half Of a golden hurt. You remember and covet his mouth To touch, to whisper on. Oh when to declare Is certain Death! Oh when to apprize Is to mesmerize, To see fall down, the Column of Gold, Into the commonest ash.Anonymous submission.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlone at the beachwith hundreds surrounding meCalm asserts itselfCruise ships crawl seawardsStarfish grapple tiny fryGulls circle aboveSun rays caress kelpIncoming waves unsettleThe tide comes closerThe old crab trap sinksNew sailboats disturb bitternsTime to face traffic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe whole idea of it makes me feellike I'm coming down with something,something worse than any stomach acheor the headaches I get from reading in bad light--a kind of measles of the spirit,a mumps of the psyche,a disfiguring chicken pox of the soul.You tell me it is too early to be looking back,but that is because you have forgottenthe perfect simplicity of being oneand the beautiful complexity introduced by two.But I can lie on my bed and remember every digit.At four I was an Arabian wizard.I could make myself invisibleby drinking a glass of milk a certain way.At seven I was a soldier, at nine a prince.But now I am mostly at the windowwatching the late afternoon light.Back then it never fell so solemnlyagainst the side of my tree house,and my bicycle never leaned against the garageas it does today,all the dark blue speed drained out of it.This is the beginning of sadness, I say to myself,as I walk through the universe in my sneakers.It is time to say good-bye to my imaginary friends,time to turn the first big number.It seems only yesterday I used to believethere was nothing under my skin but light.If you cut me I could shine.But now when I fall upon the sidewalks of life,I skin my knees.

Of grab the ways of satisfying need!Of work the men!

He pointed backwardOver his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,'You can just see it glancing off the roofMaking a great scroll upward toward the sky,Long enough for recording all our names on.-I think I'll just call up my wife and tell herI'm here-so far-and starting on again.I'll call her softly so that if she's wiseAnd gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer.'Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened.'Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I'm at Cole's. I'm late.I called you up to say Good-night from hereBefore I went to say Good-morning there.-I thought I would.- I know, but, Lett-I know-I could, but what's the sense? The rest won't beSo bad.- Give me an hour for it.- Ho, ho,Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;The rest is down.- Why no, no, not a wallow:They kept their heads and took their time to itLike darlings, both of them. They're in the barn.-My dear, I'm coming just the same. I didn'tCall you to ask you to invite me home.-'He lingered for some word she wouldn't say,Said it at last himself, 'Good-night,' and then,Getting no answer, closed the telephone.The three stood in the lamplight round the tableWith lowered eyes a moment till he said,'I'll just see how the horses are.''Yes, do,'Both the Coles said together. Mrs. ColeAdded: 'You can judge better after seeing.-I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,Brother Meserve. You know to find your wayOut through the shed.''I guess I know my way,I guess I know where I can find my nameCarved in the shed to tell me who I amIf it don't tell me where I am. I usedTo play-''You tend your horses and come back.Fred Cole, you're going to let him!''Well, aren't you?How can you help yourself?''I called him Brother.Why did I call him that?''It's right enough.That's all you ever heard him called round here.He seems to have lost off his Christian name.''Christian enough I should call that myself.He took no notice, did he? Well, at leastI didn't use it out of love of him,The dear knows. I detest the thought of himWith his ten children under ten years old.I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,All's ever I heard of it, which isn't much.But that's not saying-Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve,Isn't it, now? He's been here half an hour.He says he left the village store at nine.Three hours to do four miles-a mile an hourOr not much better. Why, it doesn't seemAs if a man could move that slow and move.Try to think what he did with all that time.And three miles more to go!''Don't let him go.Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you.That sort of man talks straight on all his lifeFrom the last thing he said himself, stone deafTo anything anyone else may say.I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you.''What is he doing out a night like this?Why can't he stay at home?''He had to preach.''It's no night to be out.''He may be small,He may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough.''And strong of stale tobacco.''He'll pull through.''You only say so. Not another houseOr shelter to put into from this placeTo theirs. I'm going to call his wife again.''Wait and he may. Let's see what he will do.Let's see if he will think of her again.But then I doubt he's thinking of himselfHe doesn't look on it as anything.''He shan't go-there!''It is a night, my dear.''One thing: he didn't drag God into it.''He don't consider it a case for God.''You think so, do you? You don't know the kind.He's getting up a miracle this minute.Privately-to himself, right now, he's thinkingHe'll make a case of it if he succeeds,But keep still if he fails.''Keep still all over.He'll be dead-dead and buried.''Such a trouble!Not but I've every reason not to careWhat happens to him if it only takesSome of the sanctimonious conceitOut of one of those pious scalawags.''Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe.''You like the runt.''Don't you a little?''Well,I don't like what he's doing, which is whatYou like, and like him for.''Oh, yes you do.You like your fun as well as anyone;Only you women have to put these airs onTo impress men. You've got us so ashamedOf being men we can't look at a good fightBetween two boys and not feel bound to stop it.Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.-He's here. I leave him all to you. Go inAnd save his life.- All right, come in, Meserve.Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?''Fine, fine.''And ready for some more? My wife hereSays it won't do. You've got to give it up.''Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to your wife.What did your wife say on the telephone?'Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lampOr something not far from it on the table.By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,He pointed with his hand from where it layLike a white crumpled spider on his knee:'That leaf there in your open book! It movedJust then, I thought. It's stood erect like that,There on the table, ever since I came,Trying to turn itself backward or forward,I've had my eye on it to make out which;If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience-You see I know-to get you on to thingsIt wants to see how you will take, if backwardIt's from regret for something you have passedAnd failed to see the good of. Never mind,Things must expect to come in front of usA many times-I don't say just how many-That varies with the things-before we see them.One of the lies would make it out that nothingEver presents itself before us twice.Where would we be at last if that were so?Our very life depends on everything'sRecurring till we answer from within.The thousandth time may prove the charm.- That leaf!It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.But the wind didn't move it if it moved.It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.It couldn't stir so sensitively poisedA thing as that. It couldn't reach the lampTo get a puff of black smoke from the flame,Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.You make a little foursquare block of air,Quiet and light and warm, in spite of allThe illimitable dark and cold and storm,And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;Though for all anyone can tell, reposeMay be the thing you haven't, yet you give it.So false it is that what we haven't we can't give;So false, that what we always say is true.I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?''I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,But if you're going- Say you'll stay, you know?But let me raise this curtain on a scene,And show you how it's piling up against you.You see the snow-white through the white of frost?Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbedSince last we read the gage.''It looks as ifSome pallid thing had squashed its features flatAnd its eyes shut with overeagernessTo see what people found so interestingIn one another, and had gone to sleepOf its own stupid lack of understanding,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuffShort off, and died against the window-pane.''Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourselfMore than you will us with such nightmare talk.It's you it matters to, because it's youWho have to go out into it alone.''Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay.''Before you drop the curtain-I'm reminded:You recollect the boy who came out hereTo breathe the air one winter-had a roomDown at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morningAfter a downy storm, he passed our placeAnd found me banking up the house with snow.And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,Piling it well above the window-sills.The snow against the window caught his eye.'Hey, that's a pretty thought'-those were his words.'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.You can't get too much winter in the winter.'Those were his words. And he went home and allBut banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.Now you and I would go to no such length.At the same time you can't deny it makesIt not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,Playing our fancy, to have the snowline runSo high across the pane outside. There whereThere is a sort of tunnel in the frostMore like a tunnel than a hole-way downAt the far end of it you see a stirAnd quiver like the frayed edge of the driftBlown in the wind. I like that-I like that.Well, now I leave you, people.''Come, Meserve,We thought you were deciding not to go-The ways you found to say the praise of comfortAnd being where you are. You want to stay.''I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.This house is frozen brittle, all exceptThis room you sit in. If you think the windSounds further off, it's not because it's dying;You're further under in the snow-that's all-And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dustIt bursts against us at the chimney mouth,And at the eaves. I like it from insideMore than I shall out in it. But the horsesAre rested and it's time to say good-night,And let you get to bed again. Good-night,Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.''Lucky for you you did. Lucky for youYou had us for a half-way stationTo stop at. If you were the kind of manPaid heed to women, you'd take my adviceAnd for your family's sake stay where you are.But what good is my saying it over and over?You've done more than you had a right to thinkYou could do-now. You know the risk you takeIn going on.''Our snow-storms as a ruleAren't looked on as man-killers, and althoughI'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleepUnder it all, his door sealed up and lost,Than the man fighting it to keep above it,Yet think of the small birds at roost and notIn nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?Their bulk in water would be frozen rockIn no time out to-night. And yet to-morrowThey will come budding boughs from tree to treeFlirting their wings and saying Chickadee,As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.''But why when no one wants you to go on?Your wife-she doesn't want you to. We don't,And you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?''Save us from being cornered by a woman.Well, there's'-She told Fred afterward that inThe pause right there, she thought the dreaded wordWas coming, 'God.' But no, he only said'Well, there's-the storm. That says I must go on.That wants me as a war might if it came.Ask any man.'He threw her that as somethingTo last her till he got outside the door.He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.When Cole returned he found his wife still standingBeside the table near the open book,Not reading it.'Well, what kind of a manDo you call that?' she said.'He had the giftOf words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?''Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?''Or disregarding people's civil questions-What? We've found out in one hour more about himThan we had seeing him pass by in the roadA thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!You didn't think you'd keep him after all.Oh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave youMuch say in the matter, and I'm just as gladWe're not in for a night of him. No sleepIf he had stayed. The least thing set him going.It's quiet as an empty church without him.''But how much better off are we as it is?We'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.''Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't.He knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try.Get into bed I say, and get some rest.He won't come back, and if he telephones,It won't be for an hour or two.''Well then- We can't be any help by sitting hereAnd living his fight through with him, I suppose.'- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Cole had been telephoning in the dark.Mrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:'Did she call you or you call her?''She me.You'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.We must have been asleep: it's three and after.''Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper.I want to speak to her.''All she said was,He hadn't come and had he really started.''She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.''He had the shovel. He'll have made a fight.''Why did I ever let him leave this house!''Don't begin that. You did the best you couldTo keep him-though perhaps you didn't quiteConceal a wish to see him show the spunkTo disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you.''Fred, after all I said! You shan't make outThat it was any way but what it was.Did she let on by any word she saidShe didn't thank me?''When I told her 'Gone,''Well then,' she said, and 'Well then'-like a threat.And then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you,Why did you let him go'?''Asked why we let him?You let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.She didn't dare to speak when he was here.Their number's-twenty-one? The thing won't work.Someone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles.The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!It's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and gone.''Try speaking. Say 'Hello'!''Hello. Hello.''What do you hear?''I hear an empty room-You know-it sounds that way. And yes, I hear-I think I hear a clock-and windows rattling.No step though. If she's there she's sitting down.''Shout, she may hear you.''Shouting is no good.''Keep speaking then.''Hello. Hello. Hello.You don't suppose-? She wouldn't go out doors?''I'm half afraid that's just what she might do.''And leave the children?''Wait and call again.You can't hear whether she has left the doorWide open and the wind's blown out the lampAnd the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?''One of two things, either she's gone to bedOr gone out doors.''In which case both are lost.Do you know what she's like? Have you ever met her?It's strange she doesn't want to speak to us.''Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.''A clock maybe.''Don't you hear something else?''Not talking.''No.''Why, yes, I hear-what is it?''What do you say it is?''A baby's crying!Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.''Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,Not if she's there.''What do you make of it?''There's only one thing possible to make,That is, assuming-that she has gone out.Of course she hasn't though.' They both sat downHelpless. 'There's nothing we can do till morning.''Fred, I shan't let you think of going out.''Hold on.' The double bell began to chirp.They started up. Fred took the telephone.'Hello, Meserve. You're there, then!-And your wife?Good! Why I asked-she didn't seem to answer.He says she went to let him in the barn.-We're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.Drop in and see us when you're passing.''Well,She has him then, though what she wants him forI don't see.''Possibly not for herself.Maybe she only wants him for the children.''The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.What did he come in for?-To talk and visit?Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.If he thinks he is going to make our houseA halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere- ''I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned.''You think you haven't been concerned yourself.''If you mean he was inconsiderateTo rout us out to think for him at midnightAnd then take our advice no more than nothing,Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him.We've had a share in one night of his life.What'll you bet he ever calls again?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDeep in the man sits fast his fate To mould his fortunes, mean or great: Unknown to Cromwell as to me Was Cromwell's measure or degree; Unknown to him as to his horse, If he than his groom be better or worse. He works, plots, fights, in rude affairs, With squires, lords, kings, his craft compares, Till late he learned, through doubt and fear, Broad England harbored not his peer: Obeying time, the last to own The Genius from its cloudy throne. For the prevision is allied Unto the thing so signified; Or say, the foresight that awaits Is the same Genius that creates.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy tears are like the quiet driftOf petals from some magic rose;And all my grief flows from the riftOf unremembered skies and snows.I think, that if I touched the earth,It would crumble;It is so sad and beautiful,So tremulously like a dream.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDown from the purple mist of trees on the mountain, lurching through forests of white spruce and cedar, stumbling through tamarack swamps,came the bull mooseto be stopped at last by a pole-fenced pasture.Too tired to turn or, perhaps, awarethere was no place left to go, he stood with the cattle.They, scenting the musk of death, seeing his great head like the ritual mask of a blood god, moved to the other end of the field, and waited.The neighbours heard of it, and by afternoon cars lined the road. The children teased himwith alder switches and he gazed at them like an old, tolerant collie. The woman asked if he could have escaped from a Fair.The oldest man in the parish remembered seeing a gelded moose yoked with an ox for plowing.The young men snickered and tried to pour beerdown his throat, while their girl friends took their pictures.And the bull moose let them stroke his tick-ravaged flanks, let them pry open his jaws with bottles, let a giggling girlplant a little purple cap of thistles on his head.When the wardens came, everyone agreed it was a shame to shoot anything so shaggy and cuddlesome.He looked like the kind of petwomen put to bed with their sons.So they held their fire. But just as the sun dropped in the river the bull moose gathered his strength like a scaffolded king, straightened and lifted his horns so that even the wardens backed away as they raised their rifles. When he roared, people ran to their cars. All the young men leaned on their automobile horns as he toppled.Submitted by cutebabystar\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe name of the author is the first to gofollowed obediently by the title, the plot,the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novelwhich suddenly becomes one you have never read,never even heard of,as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbordecided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,to a little fishing village where there are no phones.Long ago you kissed the names of the nine Muses goodbyeand watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,and even now as you memorize the order of the planets,something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.Whatever it is you are struggling to remember,it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.It has floated away down a dark mythological riverwhose name begins with an L as far as you can recall,well on your own way to oblivion where you will join thosewho have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.No wonder you rise in the middle of the nightto look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.No wonder the moon in the window seems to have driftedout of a love poem that you used to know by heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGive me your patience, sister, while I frameExact in capitals your golden name;Or sue the fair Apollo and he willRouse from his heavy slumber and instillGreat love in me for thee and Poesy.Imagine not that greatest masteryAnd kingdom over all the Realms of verse,Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurseAnd surety give to love and Brotherhood.Anthropophagi in Othello's mood;Ulysses storm'd and his enchanted belt Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt Unbosom'd so and so eternal made, Such tender incense in their laurel shadeTo all the regent sisters of the NineAs this poor offering to you, sister mine.Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;And may it taste to you like good old wine,Take you to real happiness and giveSons, daughters and a home like honied hive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ivory gods,And the ebony gods,And the gods of diamond and jade,Sit silently on their temple shelvesWhile the people Are afraid.Yet the ivory gods,And the ebony gods,And the gods of diamond-jade,Are only silly puppet godsThat the people themselvesHave made.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNever seek to tell thy love,  Love that never told can be;For the gentle wind does moveSilently, invisibly.I told my love, I told my love,I told her all my heart;Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears,Ah! she did depart!Soon as she was gone from me,A traveler came by,Silently, invisibly He took her with a sigh.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXXIXI think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and budAbout thee, as wild vines, about a tree,Put out broad leaves, and soon there 's nought to seeExcept the straggling green which hides the wood.Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understoodI will not have my thoughts instead of theeWho art dearer, better! Rather, instantlyRenew thy presence; as a strong tree should,Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,And let these bands of greenery which insphere theeDrop heavily down,—burst, shattered, everywhere!Because, in this deep joy to see and hear theeAnd breathe within thy shadow a new air,I do not think of thee—I am too near thee.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was taken some time agoAt first it seems to bea smearedprint: blurred lines and grey flecksblended with the paper;then, as you scanit, you can see something in the left-hand cornera thing that is like a branch: part of a tree(balsam or spruce) emergingand, to the right, halfway upwhat ought to be a gentleslope, a small frame house.In the background there is a lake,and beyond that, some low hills.(The photograph was takenthe day after I drowned.I am in the lake, in the centerof the picture, just under the surface.It is difficult to say whereprecisely, or to sayhow large or how small I am:the effect of wateron light is a distortion.but if you look long enougheventuallyyou will see me.)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe memory of you emerges from the night around me.The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one! Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.In you the wars and the flights accumulated.From you the wings of the song birds rose.You swallowed everything, like distance.Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank! It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank! In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.Lost discoverer, in you everything sank! You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,sadness stunned you, in you everything sank! I made the wall of shadow draw back,beyond desire and act, I walked on.Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.There was the black solitude of the islands,and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain mein the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms! How terrible and brief my desire was to you! How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.Oh the mad coupling of hope and forcein which we merged and despaired.And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.And the word scarcely begun on the lips.This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank! Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned! From billow to billow you still called and sang.Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,lost discoverer, in you everything sank! It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hourwhich the night fastens to all the timetables.The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlood has been harder to dam back than water.Just when we think we have it impounded safeBehind new barrier walls (and let it chafe!),It breaks away in some new kind of slaughter.We choose to say it is let loose by the devil;But power of blood itself releases blood.It goes by might of being such a floodHeld high at so unnatural a level.It will have outlet, brave and not so brave.weapons of war and implements of peaceAre but the points at which it finds release.And now it is once more the tidal waveThat when it has swept by leaves summits stained.Oh, blood will out. It cannot be contained.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow Let's look for birds! The tall iron branches in the forest, The dense fertility on the ground. The world is wet. A dewdrop or raindrop shines, a diminutive star among the leaves. The morning time mother earth is cool. The air is like a river which shakes the silence. It smells of rosemary, of space and roots. Overhead, a crazy song. It's a bird. How out of its throat smaller than a finger can there fall the waters of its song? Luminous ease! Invisible power torrent of music in the leaves. Sacred conversations! Clean and fresh washed is this day resounding like a green dulcimer. I bury my shoes in the mud, jump over rivulets. A thorn bites me and a gust of air like a crystal wave splits up inside my chest. Where are the birds? Maybe it was that rustling in the foliage or that fleeting pellet of brown velvet or that displaced perfume? That leaf that let loose cinnamon smell - was that a bird? That dust from an irritated magnolia or that fruit which fell with a thump - was that a flight? Oh, invisible little critters birds of the devil with their ringing with their useless feathers. I only want to caress them, to see them resplendent. I don't want to see under glass the embalmed lightning. I want to see them living. I want to touch their gloves of real hide, which they never forget in the branches and to converse with them sitting on my shoulders although they may leave me like certain statues undeservedly whitewashed. Impossible. You can't touch them. You can hear them like a heavenly rustle or movement. They converse with precision. They repeat their observations. They brag of how much they do. They comment on everything that exists. They learn certain sciences like hydrography. and by a sure science they know where there are harvests of grain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe thought he saw an ElephantThat practised on a fife:He looked again, and found it wasA letter from his wife.'At length I realize,' he said,'The bitterness of life!

II    He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,     A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;     They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!     And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,                       His pistol butts a-twinkle,     His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.                                                 III    Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,     And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;     He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.                                                 IV    And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked     Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;     His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,     But he loved the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's red-lipped daughter,     Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—                                                 V    'One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,     But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;     Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,     Then look for me by moonlight,                       Watch for me by moonlight,     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.'                                                 VI    He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,     But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand     As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;     And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,                       (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)     Then he tugged at his rein in the moonliglt, and galloped away to the West.                                         PART TWO                                                 I    He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;     And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,     When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,     A red-coat troop came marching—                       Marching—marching—     King George's men came matching, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,     But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;     Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!     There was death at every window;                       And hell at one dark window;     For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.                                                 III    They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;     They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!     'Now, keep good watch!' and they kissed her.                       She heard the dead man say—     Look for me by moonlight;                       Watch for me by moonlight;     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!                                                 IV    She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!     She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!     They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,     Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,                       Cold, on the stroke of midnight,     The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!                                                 V    The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!     Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,     She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;     For the road lay bare in the moonlight;                       Blank and bare in the moonlight;     And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain .                                                 VI        Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;     Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?     Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,     The highwayman came riding,                       Riding, riding!     The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!                                                 VII    Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!     Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!     Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,     Then her finger moved in the moonlight,                       Her musket shattered the moonlight,     Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.                                                 VIII    He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood     Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!     Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear     How Bess, the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's black-eyed daughter,     Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.                                                 IX    Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,     With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!     Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,     When they shot him down on the highway,                       Down like a dog on the highway,     And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.                                                 X    And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,     When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     A highwayman comes riding—                       Riding—riding—     A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 XI    Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;     He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;     He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGood love is all you've been giving loving you make life worth living I love the way you love me and cherish the way you fulfill my every need I'm glad we have found one another knowing that our love will last forever it feel good knowing love is in my heart knowing our love will never part I love the little things you do for me just to please and make me happy Here with each other is where we will lay because in my dreams and heart you'll always stay\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Rock, A River, A TreeHosts to species long since departed,Mark the mastodon.The dinosaur, who left dry tokensOf their sojourn hereOn our planet floor,Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doomIs lost in the gloom of dust and ages.But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,Come, you may stand upon myBack and face your distant destiny,But seek no haven in my shadow.I will give you no hiding place down here.You, created only a little lower thanThe angels, have crouched too long inThe bruising darkness,Have lain too longFace down in ignorance.Your mouths spelling wordsArmed for slaughter.The rock cries out today, you may stand on me,But do not hide your face.Across the wall of the world,A river sings a beautiful song,Come rest here by my side.Each of you a bordered country,Delicate and strangely made proud,Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.Your armed struggles for profitHave left collars of waste uponMy shore, currents of debris upon my breast.Yet, today I call you to my riverside,If you will study war no more.Come, clad in peace and I will sing the songsThe Creator gave to me when IAnd the tree and stone were one.Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your browAnd when you yet knew you still knew nothing.The river sings and sings on.There is a true yearning to respond toThe singing river and the wise rock.So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew,The African and Native American, the Sioux,The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek,The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheikh,The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,The privileged, the homeless, the teacher.They hear.

Quiet consummation have; And renowned be thy grave!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFreedom from fear is the freedomI claim for you my motherland!Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoningcall of the future;Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewithyou fasten yourself in night's stillness,mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;freedom from the anarchy of destinywhole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,where movements are started through brainless wires,repeated through mindless habits,where figures wait with patience and obedience for the master of show,to be stirred into a mimicry of life.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Xanadu did Kubla KhanA stately pleasure-dome decree :Where Alph, the sacred river, ranThrough caverns measureless to man     Down to a sunless sea.So twice five miles of fertile groundWith walls and towers were girdled round :And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;And here were forests ancient as the hills,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !A savage place ! as holy and enchantedAs e'er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon-lover !And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,A mighty fountain momently was forced :Amid whose swift half-intermitted burstHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and everIt flung up momently the sacred river.Five miles meandering with a mazy motionThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from farAncestral voices prophesying war !     The shadow of the dome of pleasure     Floated midway on the waves ;     Where was heard the mingled measure     From the fountain and the caves.It was a miracle of rare device,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !     A damsel with a dulcimer     In a vision once I saw :     It was an Abyssinian maid,     And on her dulcimer she played,     Singing of Mount Abora.     Could I revive within me     Her symphony and song,     To such a deep delight 'twould win me,That with music loud and long,I would build that dome in air,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !And all who heard should see them there,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !His flashing eyes, his floating hair !Weave a circle round him thrice,And close your eyes with holy dread,For he on honey-dew hath fed,And drunk the milk of Paradise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you die before meI would jump down into your graveand hug you so innocentlythat angels will become jealous.I shall kiss you.So intimately shall I kiss youthat your breath becomes mine.In one breath of love shall we merge into hugs of true joy.Your heart shall beatin rhythms unheardlike the drums of the desertand the wild forest in the night.You shall murmur in my ears: 'Oh  press me to your chest; Tear open your chest, Make way for me to enter into your loving heartthat beats only for me in resounding colors.Tell me please Oh my loverIs it a rainbow that I see? or the glow of a burning pyre? Why is it that I cannot utter it in words? Tell me glorious angels of love: What am I experiencing in uncountablemoments of indescribable inner comfort? Shivering in your presenceI shall long to dance with you.If the dark souls lead you to HadesI will dance and dance with youeven in the nether world.We shall dance soft and then wild.We shall dance togetheras one body and soul and break the fetters of hellthrough love that emanates from our dance.Dance so long and fine like a poemuntil the Lords of the dark would faint.Breaking the fetters of Hadesthe white angels  attired in beautyshall fly down to pick you up on golden cradlesand carry you to the world of God.So  you will be free and fly away from me into the world of the heavenswhere angels shall kiss your sacred body.You will be attired in gold and whiteand in varied colors in tune with the flowers of heaven.Then you need no space to live and breathe.Into that world of purity you will goand I will be here on earthdreaming of your joys with the Heavenly spirits.Shall I wait? Shall I wait at dusk and dawnin sobs and a heaving heartwith such desire and passionto reach you one day in your world of happiness.(It is the belief that once your lady love dies before you, she has to go to the Hades and there she has to dance so fiercely and lovingly to make the Lords of Darkness faint and then she shall be free from the chains of hell.Here the living lover is ready to go to hell to dance with her most fiercely and save her from the hell)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGo beyond the past.Go beyond the present..Will you love me when nightFalls and nordic winds blowAll those drunken eyes out?

Sweet dreams of pleasant streams By happy, silent, moony beams!  Sweet Sleep, with soft down Weave thy brows an infant crown Sweet Sleep, angel mild, Hover o'er my happy child!  Sweet smiles, in the night Hover over my delight! Sweet smiles, mother's smile, All the livelong night beguile.  Sweet moans, dovelike sighs, Chase not slumber from thine eyes! Sweet moan, sweeter smile, All the dovelike moans beguile.  Sleep, sleep, happy child! All creation slept and smiled. Sleep, sleep, happy sleep, While o'er thee doth mother weep.  Sweet babe, in thy face Holy image I can trace; Sweet babe, once like thee Thy Maker lay, and wept for me:  Wept for me, for thee, for all, When He was an infant small. Thou His image ever see, Heavenly face that smiles on thee!  Smiles on thee, on me, on all, Who became an infant small; Infant smiles are his own smiles; Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere where the waves shatter on the restless rocksthe clear light bursts and enacts its rose,and the sea-circle shrinks to a cluster of buds,to one drop of blue salt, falling.O bright magnolia bursting in the foam,magnetic transient whose death bloomsand vanishes--being, nothingness--forever:broken salt, dazzling lurch of the sea.You & I, Love, together we ratify the silence,while the sea destroys its perpetual statues,collapses its towers of wild speed and whiteness:because in the weavings of those invisible fabrics,galloping water, incessant sand,we make the only permanent tenderness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wish I could take a quiet corner in the heart of my baby's veryown world.    I know it has stars that talk to him, and a sky that stoopsdown to his face to amuse him with its silly clouds and rainbows.    Those who make believe to be dumb, and look as if they nevercould move, come creeping to his window with their stories and withtrays crowded with bright toys.    I wish I could travel by the road that crosses baby's mind,and out beyond all bounds;    Where messengers run errands for no cause between the kingdomsof kings of no history;    Where Reason makes kites of her laws and flies them, the Truthsets Fact free from its fetters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may tread me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I'll rise.Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard'Cause I laugh like I've got gold minesDiggin' in my own back yard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise.Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I've got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shameI riseUp from a past that's rooted in painI riseI'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that's wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI Among twenty snowy mountains, The only moving thing Was the eye of the black bird.

A man and a woman and a blackbird Are one. V I do not know which to prefer, The beauty of inflections Or the beauty of innuendoes, The blackbird whistling Or just after. VI Icicles filled the long window With barbaric glass. The shadow of the blackbird Crossed it, to and fro. The mood Traced in the shadow An indecipherable cause. VII O thin men of Haddam, Why do you imagine golden birds? Do you not see how the blackbird Walks around the feet Of the women about you? VIII I know noble accents And lucid, inescapable rhythms; But I know, too, That the blackbird is involved In what I know. IX When the blackbird flew out of sight, It marked the edge Of one of many circles. X At the sight of blackbirds Flying in a green light, Even the bawds of euphony Would cry out sharply. XI He rode over Connecticut In a glass coach. Once, a fear pierced him, In that he mistook The shadow of his equipage For blackbirds. XII The river is moving. The blackbird must be flying. XIII It was evening all afternoon. It was snowing And it was going to snow. The blackbird sat In the cedar-limbs.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   O HYMEN! O hymenee!

Thou dirgeOf the dying year, to which this closing nightWill be the dome of a vast sepulchre,Vaulted with all thy congregated mightOf vapors, from whose solid atmosphereBlack rain, and fire, and hail will burst: oh, hear!IIIThou who didst waken from his summer dreamsThe blue Mediterranean, where he lay,Lulled by the coil of his crystalline streams,Beside a pumice isle in Baiae's bay,And saw in sleep old palaces and towersQuivering within the wave's intenser day,All overgrown with azure moss and flowersSo sweet, the sense faints picturing them! ThouFor whose path the Atlantic's level powersCleave themselves into chasms, while far belowThe sea-blooms and the oozy woods which wearThe sapless foliage of the ocean, knowThy voice, and suddenly grow gray with fear,And tremble and despoil themselves: oh, hear!IVIf I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear;If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee;A wave to pant beneath thy power, and shareThe impulse of thy strength, only less freeThan thou, O uncontrollable! If evenI were as in my boyhood, and could beThe comrade of thy wanderings over Heaven,As then, when to outstrip thy skiey speedScarce seemed a vision; I would ne'er have strivenAs thus with thee in prayer in my sore need.Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!A heavy weight of hours has chained and bowedOne too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.VMake me thy lyre, even as the forest is:What if my leaves are falling like its own!The tumult of thy mighty harmoniesWill take from both a deep, autumnal tone,Sweet though in sadness. Be thou, Spirit fierce,My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!Drive my dead thoughts over the universeLike withered leaves to quicken a new birth!And, by the incantation of this verse,Scatter, as from an unextinguished hearthAshes and sparks, my words among mankind!Be through my lips to unawakened earthThe trumpet of a prophecy!

I got it from crawling along in the dirtAnd biting two buttons off Jeremy's shirt.I got it from chewing the roots of a roseAnd digging for clams in the yard with my nose.I got it from peeking into a dark caveAnd painting myself like a Navajo brave.I got it from playing with coal in the binAnd signing my name in cement with my chin.I got if from rolling around on the rugAnd giving the horrible dog a big hug.I got it from finding a lost silver mineAnd eating sweet blackberries right off the vine.I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tearsAnd from having more fun than you've had in years.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen a friend calls to me from the road And slows his horse to a meaning walk, I don't stand still and look around On all the hills I haven't hoed, And shout from where I am, What is it? No, not as there is a time to talk. I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground, Blade-end up and five feet tall, And plod: I go up to the stone wall For a friendly visit.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThough my mother was already two years deadDad kept her slippers warming by the gas,put hot water bottles her side of the bedand still went to renew her transport pass.You couldn't just drop in. You had to phone.He'd put you off an hour to give him time to clear away her things and look alone as though his still raw love were such a crime.He couldn't risk my blight of disbeliefthough sure that very soon he'd hear her keyscrape in the rusted lock and end his grief.He knew she'd just popped out to get the tea.I believe life ends with death, and that is all.You haven't both gone shopping; just the same,in my new black leather phone book there's your name and the disconnected number I still call.Submitted by Scott Dagostino\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou declare you see me dimly through a glass which will not shine, though I stand before you boldly, trim in rank and marking time. You do own to hear me faintly as a whisper out of range, while my drums beat out the message and the rhythms never change.Equality, and I will be free. Equality, and I will be free.You announce my ways are wanton, that I fly from man to man, but if I'm just a shadow to you, could you ever understand ?We have lived a painful history, we know the shameful past, but I keep on marching forward, and you keep on coming last.Equality, and I will be free. Equality, and I will be free.Take the blinders from your vision, take the padding from your ears, and confess you've heard me crying, and admit you've seen my tears.Hear the tempo so compelling, hear the blood throb in my veins. Yes, my drums are beating nightly, and the rhythms never change.Equality, and I will be free. Equality, and I will be free.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a boughwithout ever having felt sorry for itself.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-    \"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.    We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.\"    I ask, \"But how am I to get up to you ?\"    They answer, \"Come to the edge of the earth, lift up yourhands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.\"    \"My mother is waiting for me at home, \"I say, \"How can I leaveher and come?\"    Then they smile and float away.    But I know a nicer game than that, mother.    I shall be the cloud and you the moon.    I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top willbe the blue sky.    The folk who live in the waves call out to me-    \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and knownot where we pass.\"    I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"    They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand withyour eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"    I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the everything-how can I leave her and go?\"    They smile, dance and pass by.    But I know a better game than that.    I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.    I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap withlaughter.    And no one in the world will know where we both are.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was too lonely for her there,And too wild,And since there were but two of them,And no child,And work was little in the house,She was free,And followed where he furrowed field,Or felled tree.She rested on a log and tossedThe fresh chips,With a song only to herselfOn her lips.And once she went to break a boughOf black alder.She strayed so far she scarcely heardWhen he called her-And didn't answer-didn't speak-Or return.She stood, and then she ran and hidIn the fern.He never found her, though he lookedEverywhere,And he asked at her mother's houseWas she there.Sudden and swift and light as thatThe ties gave,And he learned of finalitiesBesides the grave.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, 'Speak to us of Children.' And he said: Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you, And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts. You may house their bodies but not their souls, For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams. You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you. For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday. You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth. The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far. Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness; For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI loved you, and I probably still do,And for a while the feeling may remain...But let my love no longer trouble you,I do not wish to cause you any pain.I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -Made up a love so tender and so trueAs may God grant you to be loved again.Translated by Genia Gurarie, 11/10/95\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a pleasure in the pathless woods, There is a rapture on the lonely shore, There is society, where none intrudes, By the deep sea, and music in its roar: I love not man the less, but Nature more, From these our interviews, in which I steal From all I may be, or have been before, To mingle with the Universe, and feel What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I was young, I used toWatch behind the curtainsAs men walked up and down the street. Wino men, old men.Young men sharp as mustard.See them. Men are alwaysGoing somewhere.They knew I was there. FifteenYears old and starving for them.Under my window, they would pauses,Their shoulders high like theBreasts of a young girl,Jacket tails slapping overThose behinds,Men.One day they hold you in thePalms of their hands, gentle, as if youWere the last raw egg in the world. ThenThey tighten up. Just a little. TheFirst squeeze is nice. A quick hug.Soft into your defenselessness. A littleMore. The hurt begins. Wrench out aSmile that slides around the fear. When theAir disappears,Your mind pops, exploding fiercely, briefly,Like the head of a kitchen match. Shattered.It is your juiceThat runs down their legs. Staining their shoes.When the earth rights itself again,And taste tries to return to the tongue,Your body has slammed shut. Forever.No keys exist.Then the window draws full uponYour mind. There, just beyondThe sway of curtains, men walk.Knowing something.Going someplace.But this time, I will simplyStand and watch.Maybe.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are holes in the skyWhere the rain gets inBut there ever so smallThat's why the rain is thin.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBlow, blow, thou winter wind Thou art not so unkind As man's ingratitude; Thy tooth is not so keen, Because thou art not seen, Although thy breath be rude. Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most freindship if feigning, most loving mere folly: Then heigh-ho, the holly! This life is most jolly. Freeze, freeze thou bitter sky, That does not bite so nigh As benefits forgot: Though thou the waters warp, Thy sting is not so sharp As a friend remembered not. Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly: Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly: Then heigh-ho, the holly! This life is most jolly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHis vision, from the constantly passing bars,has grown so weary that it cannot holdanything else. It seems to him there area thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,the movement of his powerful soft stridesis like a ritual dance around a centerin which a mighty will stands paralyzed.Only at times, the curtain of the pupilslifts, quietly--. An image enters in,rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,plunges into the heart and is gone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere had I heard this wind beforeChange like this to a deeper roar? What would it take my standing there for,Holding open a restive door,Looking down hill to a frothy shore? Summer was past and the day was past.Sombre clouds in the west were massed.Out on the porch's sagging floor,Leaves got up in a coil and hissed,Blindly struck at my knee and missed.Something sinister in the toneTold me my secret must be known:Word I was in the house aloneSomehow must have gotten abroad,Word I was in my life alone,Word I had no one left but God.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. The works that I have in hand I will finish afterwards. Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil. Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove. Now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow shall the burial rite be read? The solemn song be sung? The requiem for the loveliest dead,That ever died so young? II.Her friends are gazing on her,And on her gaudy bier,And weep! - oh! to dishonorDead beauty with a tear! III.They loved her for her wealth -And they hated her for her pride -But she grew in feeble health,And they love her - that she died.IV.They tell me (while they speakOf her 'costly broider'd pall') That my voice is growing weak -That I should not sing at all -V.Or that my tone should beTun'd to such solemn songSo mournfully - so mournfully,That the dead may feel no wrong.VI.But she is gone above,With young Hope at her side,And I am drunk with loveOf the dead, who is my bride. -VII.Of the dead - dead who liesAll perfum'd there,With the death upon her eyes,And the life upon her hair.VIII.Thus on the coffin loud and longI strike - the murmur sentThrough the grey chambers to my song,Shall be the accompaniment.IX.Thou died'st in thy life's June -But thou did'st not die too fair:Thou did'st not die too soon,Nor with too calm an air.X.From more than fiends on earth,Thy life and love are riven,To join the untainted mirthOf more than thrones in heaven -XII.Therefore, to thee this nightI will no requiem raise,But waft thee on thy flight,With a Pæan of old days.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t`You know Orion always comes up sideways. Throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains, And rising on his hands, he looks in on me Busy outdoors by lantern-light with something I should have done by daylight, and indeed, After the ground is frozen, I should have done Before it froze, and a gust flings a handful Of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney To make fun of my way of doing things, Or else fun of Orion's having caught me. Has a man, I should like to ask, no rights These forces are obliged to pay respect to?' So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming, Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming He burned his house down for the fire insurance And spent the proceeds on a telescope To satisfy a lifelong curiosity About our place among the infinities. `What do you want with one of those blame things?' I asked him well beforehand. `Don't you get one!' `Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything More blameless in the sense of being less A weapon in our human fight,' he said. `I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.' There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground And plowed between the rocks he couldn't move, Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years Trying to sell his farm and then not selling, He burned his house down for the fire insurance And bought the telescope with what it came to. He had been heard to say by several: `The best thing that we're put here for's to see; The strongest thing that's given us to see with's A telescope. Someone in every town Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one. In Littleton it might as well be me.' After such loose talk it was no surprise When he did what he did and burned his house down. Mean laughter went about the town that day To let him know we weren't the least imposed on, And he could wait---we'd see to him tomorrow. But the first thing next morning we reflected If one by one we counted people out For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long To get so we had no one left to live with. For to be social is to be forgiving. Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us, We don't cut off from coming to church suppers, But what we miss we go to him and ask for. He promptly gives it back, that is if still Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of. It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad About his telescope. Beyond the age Of being given one for Christmas gift, He had to take the best way he knew how To find himself in one. Well, all we said was He took a strange thing to be roguish over. Some sympathy was wasted on the house, A good old-timer dating back along; But a house isn't sentient; the house Didn't feel anything. And if it did, Why not regard it as a sacrifice, And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire, Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction? Out of a house and so out of a farm At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn To earn a living on the Concord railroad, As under-ticket-agent at a station Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets, Was setting out, up track and down, not plants As on a farm, but planets, evening stars That varied in their hue from red to green. He got a good glass for six hundred dollars. His new job gave him leisure for stargazing. Often he bid me come and have a look Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside, At a star quaking in the other end. I recollect a night of broken clouds And underfoot snow melted down to ice, And melting further in the wind to mud. Bradford and I had out the telescope. We spread our two legs as we spread its three, Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it, And standing at our leisure till the day broke, Said some of the best things we ever said. That telescope was christened the Star-Splitter, Because it didn't do a thing but split A star in two or three, the way you split A globule of quicksilver in your hand With one stroke of your finger in the middle. It's a star-splitter if there ever was one, And ought to do some good if splitting stars 'Sa thing to be compared with splitting wood. We've looked and looked, but after all where are we? Do we know any better where we are, And how it stands between the night tonight And a man with a smoky lantern chimney? How different from the way it ever stood?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBe nice to yu turkeys dis christmas Cos' turkeys just wanna hav fun Turkeys are cool, turkeys are wicked An every turkey has a Mum.

Tyger! burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare sieze the fire? And what shoulder, & what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears, And water'd heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI came out alone on my way to my tryst. But who is this that follows me in the silent dark? I move aside to avoid his presence but I escape him not. He makes the dust rise from the earth with his swagger; he adds his loud voice to every word that I utter. He is my own little self, my lord, he knows no shame; but I am ashamed to come to thy door in his company. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the milky way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed- and gazed- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere where the waves shatter on the restless rocksthe clear light bursts and enacts its rose,and the sea-circle shrinks to a cluster of buds,to one drop of blue salt, falling.O bright magnolia bursting in the foam,magnetic transient whose death bloomsand vanishes--being, nothingness--forever:broken salt, dazzling lurch of the sea.You & I, Love, together we ratify the silence,while the sea destroys its perpetual statues,collapses its towers of wild speed and whiteness:because in the weavings of those invisible fabrics,galloping water, incessant sand,we make the only permanent tenderness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow can I keep my soul in me, so thatit doesn't touch your soul? How can I raiseit high enough, past you, to other things?I would like to shelter it, among remotelost objects, in some dark and silent placethat doesn't resonate when your depths resound.Yet everything that touches us, me and you,takes us together like a violin's bow,which draws *one* voice out of two separate strings.Upon what instrument are we two spanned?And what musician holds us in his hand?Oh sweetest song.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThese pools that, though in forests, still reflectThe total sky almost without defect,And like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,Will like the flowers beside them soon be gone,And yet not out by any brook or river,But up by roots to bring dark foliage on. The trees that have it in their pent-up budsTo darken nature and be summer woods -Let them think twice before they use their powersTo blot out and drink up and sweep awayThese flowery waters and these watery flowersFrom snow that melted only yesterday.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you turn the cornerAnd you run into yourselfThen you know that you have turnedAll the corners that are left\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocracy will not comeToday, this yearNor everThrough compromise and fear.I have as much right As the other fellow hasTo standOn my two feet And own the land.I tire so of hearing people say, Let things take their course.Tomorrow is another day.I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.FreedomIs a strong seedPlantedIn a great need.I live here, too.I want freedomJust as you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBetween us now and here -    Two thrown together Who are not wont to wear    Life's flushest feather - Who see the scenes slide past, The daytimes dimming fast, Let there be truth at last,    Even if despair. So thoroughly and long    Have you now known me, So real in faith and strong    Have I now shown me, That nothing needs disguise Further in any wise, Or asks or justifies    A guarded tongue. Face unto face, then, say,    Eyes mine own meeting, Is your heart far away,    Or with mine beating? When false things are brought low, And swift things have grown slow, Feigning like froth shall go,    Faith be for aye.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe tree has entered my hands,The sap has ascended my arms,The tree has grown in my breast -Downward,The branches grow out of me, like arms.Tree you are,Moss you are,You are violets with wind above them.A child - so high - you are,And all this is folly to the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Augustus Gloop! Augustus Gloop!The great big greedy nincompoop!How long could we allow this beastTo gorge and guzzle, feed and feastOn everything he wanted to?Great Scott! It simply wouldn't do!However long this pig might live,We're positive he'd never giveEven the smallest bit of funOr happiness to anyone.So what we do in cases suchAs this, we use the gentle touch,And carefully we take the bratAnd turn him into something thatWill give great pleasure to us all–A doll, for instance, or a ball,Or marbles or a rocking horse.But this revolting boy, of course,Was so unutterably vile,So greedy, foul, and infantileHe left a most disgusting tasteInside our mouths, and so in hasteWe chose a thing that, come what may,Would take the nasty taste away.'Come on!' we cried, 'The time is ripeTo send him shooting up the pipe!He has to go! It has to be!'And very soon, he's going to seeInside the room to which he's goneSome funny things are going on.But don't, dear children, be alarmed;Augustus Gloop will not be harmed,Although, of course, we must admitHe will be altered quite a bit.He'll be quite changed from what he's been,When he goes through the fudge machine:Slowly, the wheels go round and round,The cogs begin to grind and pound;A hundred knives go slice, slice, slice;We add some sugar, cream, and spice;We boil him for a minute more,Until we're absolutely sureThat all the greed and all the gallIs boiled away for once and all.Then out he comes! And now! By grace!A miracle has taken place!This boy, who only just beforeWas loathed by men from shore to shore,This greedy brute, this louse's ear,Is loved by people everywhere!For who could hate or bear a grudgeAgainst a luscious bit of fudge?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI guess you think you know this story.You don't. The real one's much more gory.The phoney one, the one you know,Was cooked up years and years ago,And made to sound all soft and sappyjust to keep the children happy.Mind you, they got the first bit right,The bit where, in the dead of night,The Ugly Sisters, jewels and all,Departed for the Palace Ball,While darling little CinderellaWas locked up in a slimy cellar,Where rats who wanted things to eat,Began to nibble at her feet.She bellowed 'Help!' and 'Let me out!The Magic Fairy heard her shout.Appearing in a blaze of light,She said: 'My dear, are you all right?''All right?' cried Cindy .'Can't you see'I feel as rotten as can be!'She beat her fist against the wall,And shouted, 'Get me to the Ball!'There is a Disco at the Palace!'The rest have gone and I am jealous!'I want a dress! I want a coach!'And earrings and a diamond brooch!'And silver slippers, two of those!'And lovely nylon panty hose!'Done up like that I'll guarantee'The handsome Prince will fall for me!'The Fairy said, 'Hang on a tick.'She gave her wand a mighty flickAnd quickly, in no time at all,Cindy was at the Palace Ball!It made the Ugly Sisters winceTo see her dancing with the Prince.She held him very tight and pressedherself against his manly chest.The Prince himself was turned to pulp,All he could do was gasp and gulp.Then midnight struck. She shouted,'Heck!I've got to run to save my neck!'The Prince cried, 'No! Alas! Alack!'He grabbed her dress to hold her back.As Cindy shouted, 'Let me go!'The dress was ripped from head to toe.She ran out in her underwear,And lost one slipper on the stair.The Prince was on it like a dart,He pressed it to his pounding heart,'The girl this slipper fits,' he cried,'Tomorrow morn shall be my bride!I'll visit every house in town'Until I've tracked the maiden down!'Then rather carelessly, I fear,He placed it on a crate of beer.At once, one of the Ugly Sisters,(The one whose face was blotched with blisters)Sneaked up and grabbed the dainty shoe,And quickly flushed it down the loo.Then in its place she calmly putThe slipper from her own left foot.Ah ha, you see, the plot grows thicker,And Cindy's luck starts looking sicker.Next day, the Prince went charging downTo knock on all the doors in town.In every house, the tension grew.Who was the owner of the shoe?The shoe was long and very wide.(A normal foot got lost inside.)Also it smelled a wee bit icky.(The owner's feet were hot and sticky.)Thousands of eager people cameTo try it on, but all in vain.Now came the Ugly Sisters' go.One tried it on. The Prince screamed, 'No!'But she screamed, 'Yes! It fits! Whoopee!'So now you've got to marry me!'The Prince went white from ear to ear.He muttered, 'Let me out of here.''Oh no you don't! You made a vow!'There's no way you can back out now!''Off with her head!'The Prince roared back.They chopped it off with one big whack.This pleased the Prince. He smiled and said,'She's prettier without her head.'Then up came Sister Number Two,Who yelled, 'Now I will try the shoe!''Try this instead!' the Prince yelled back.He swung his trusty sword and smackHer head went crashing to the ground.It bounced a bit and rolled around.In the kitchen, peeling spuds,Cinderella heard the thudsOf bouncing heads upon the floor,And poked her own head round the door.'What's all the racket? 'Cindy cried.'Mind your own bizz,' the Prince replied.Poor Cindy's heart was torn to shreds.My Prince! she thought. He chops off heads!How could I marry anyoneWho does that sort of thing for fun?The Prince cried, 'Who's this dirty slut?'Off with her nut!

D'you think you can?'Within a minute, CinderellaWas married to a lovely feller,A simple jam maker by trade,Who sold good home-made marmalade.Their house was filled with smiles and laughterAnd they were happy ever after.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe make ourselves a place apartBehind light words that tease and flout,But oh, the agitated heartTill someone find us really out.'Tis pity if the case require(Or so we say) that in the endWe speak the literal to inspireThe understanding of a friend.But so with all, from babes that playAt hide-and-seek to God afar,So all who hide too well awayMust speak and tell us where they are.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce a dream did weave a shade O'er my angel-guarded bed, That an emmet lost its way Where on grass methought I lay.  Troubled, wildered, and forlorn, Dark, benighted, travel-worn, Over many a tangle spray, All heart-broke, I heard her say:  'Oh my children! do they cry, Do they hear their father sigh?  Now they look abroad to see, Now return and weep for me.'  Pitying, I dropped a tear: But I saw a glow-worm near, Who replied, 'What wailing wight Calls the watchman of the night?   'I am set to light the ground, While the beetle goes his round: Follow now the beetle's hum;  Little wanderer, hie thee home! '\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThree weeks gone and the combatants gonereturning over the nightmare groundwe found the place again, and foundthe soldier sprawling in the sun.The frowning barrel of his gunovershadowing. As we came onthat day, he hit my tank with onelike the entry of a demon.Look. Here in the gunpit spoilthe dishonoured picture of his girlwho has put: Steffi. Vergissmeinnicht.in a copybook gothic script.We see him almost with content,abased, and seeming to have paidand mocked at by his own equipmentthat's hard and good when he's decayed.But she would weep to see todayhow on his skin the swart flies move;the dust upon the paper eyeand the burst stomach like a cave.For here the lover and killer are mingledwho had one body and one heart.And death who had the soldier singledhas done the lover mortal hurt.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHis vision, from the constantly passing bars,has grown so weary that it cannot holdanything else. It seems to him there area thousand bars; and behind the bars, no world.As he paces in cramped circles, over and over,the movement of his powerful soft stridesis like a ritual dance around a centerin which a mighty will stands paralyzed.Only at times, the curtain of the pupilslifts, quietly--. An image enters in,rushes down through the tensed, arrested muscles,plunges into the heart and is gone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere are you, my beloved? Are you in that little Paradise, watering the flowers who look upon you As infants look upon the breast of their mothers? Or are you in your chamber where the shrine of Virtue has been placed in your honor, and upon Which you offer my heart and soul as sacrifice? Or amongst the books, seeking human knowledge, While you are replete with heavenly wisdom? Oh companion of my soul, where are you? Are you Praying in the temple? Or calling Nature in the Field, haven of your dreams? Are you in the huts of the poor, consoling the Broken-hearted with the sweetness of your soul, and Filling their hands with your bounty? You are God's spirit everywhere; You are stronger than the ages. Do you have memory of the day we met, when the halo of You spirit surrounded us, and the Angels of Love Floated about, singing the praise of the soul's deed? Do you recollect our sitting in the shade of the Branches, sheltering ourselves from Humanity, as the ribs Protect the divine secret of the heart from injury? Remember you the trails and forest we walked, with hands Joined, and our heads leaning against each other, as if We were hiding ourselves within ourselves? Recall you the hour I bade you farewell, And the Maritime kiss you placed on my lips? That kiss taught me that joining of lips in Love Reveals heavenly secrets which the tongue cannot utter! That kiss was introduction to a great sigh, Like the Almighty's breath that turned earth into man. That sigh led my way into the spiritual world, Announcing the glory of my soul; and there It shall perpetuate until again we meet. I remember when you kissed me and kissed me, With tears coursing your cheeks, and you said, \"Earthly bodies must often separate for earthly purpose, And must live apart impelled by worldly intent. \"But the spirit remains joined safely in the hands of Love, until death arrives and takes joined souls to God. \"Go, my beloved; Love has chosen you her delegate; Over her, for she is Beauty who offers to her follower The cup of the sweetness of life. As for my own empty arms, your love shall remain my Comforting groom; you memory, my Eternal wedding.\" Where are you now, my other self? Are you awake in The silence of the night? Let the clean breeze convey To you my heart's every beat and affection. Are you fondling my face in your memory? That image Is no longer my own, for Sorrow has dropped his Shadow on my happy countenance of the past. Sobs have withered my eyes which reflected your beauty And dried my lips which you sweetened with kisses. Where are you, my beloved? Do you hear my weeping From beyond the ocean? Do you understand my need? Do you know the greatness of my patience? Is there any spirit in the air capable of conveying To you the breath of this dying youth? Is there any Secret communication between angels that will carry to You my complaint? Where are you, my beautiful star? The obscurity of life Has cast me upon its bosom; sorrow has conquered me. Sail your smile into the air; it will reach and enliven me! Breathe your fragrance into the air; it will sustain me! Where are you, me beloved? Oh, how great is Love! And how little am I!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGive me your patience, sister, while I frameExact in capitals your golden name;Or sue the fair Apollo and he willRouse from his heavy slumber and instillGreat love in me for thee and Poesy.Imagine not that greatest masteryAnd kingdom over all the Realms of verse,Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurseAnd surety give to love and Brotherhood.Anthropophagi in Othello's mood;Ulysses storm'd and his enchanted belt Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt Unbosom'd so and so eternal made, Such tender incense in their laurel shadeTo all the regent sisters of the NineAs this poor offering to you, sister mine.Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;And may it taste to you like good old wine,Take you to real happiness and giveSons, daughters and a home like honied hive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wonder about the trees.Why do we wish to bearForever the noise of theseMore than another noiseSo close to our dwelling place?We suffer them by the dayTill we lose all measure of pace,And fixity in our joys,And acquire a listening air.They are that that talks of goingBut never gets away;And that talks no less for knowing,As it grows wiser and older,That now it means to stay.My feet tug at the floorAnd my head sways to my shoulderSometimes when I watch trees sway,From the window or the door.I shall set forth for somewhere,I shall make the reckless choiceSome day when they are in voiceAnd tossing so as to scareThe white clouds over them on.I shall have less to say,But I shall be gone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow great my grief, my joys how few, Since first it was my fate to know thee! - Have the slow years not brought to view How great my grief, my joys how few, Nor memory shaped old times anew,    Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee How great my grief, my joys how few,    Since first it was my fate to know thee?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a word we use to plugholes with. It's the right size for those warmblanks in speech, for those red heart-shaped vacancies on the page that look nothinglike real hearts. Add laceand you can sellit. We insert it also in the one emptyspace on the printed formthat comes with no instructions. There are wholemagazines with not much in thembut the word love, you canrub it all over your body and youcan cook with it too. How do we knowit isn't what goes on at the cooldebaucheries of slugs under damppieces of cardboard? As for the weed-seedlings nosing their tough snouts upamong the lettuces, they shout it.Love! Love! sing the soldiers, raisingtheir glittering knives in salute.Then there's the twoof us. This wordis far too short for us, it has onlyfour letters, too sparseto fill those deep barevacuums between the starsthat press on us with their deafness.It's not love we don't wishto fall into, but that fear.this word is not enough but it willhave to do. It's a singlevowel in this metallicsilence, a mouth that saysO again and again in wonderand pain, a breath, a fingergrip on a cliffside. You canhold on or let go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I see birches bend to left and rightAcross the lines of straighter darker trees,I like to think some boy's been swinging them.But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen themLoaded with ice a sunny winter morningAfter a rain. They click upon themselvesAs the breeze rises, and turn many-colouredAs the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shellsShattering and avalanching on the snow-crustSuch heaps of broken glass to sweep awayYou'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowedSo low for long, they never right themselves:You may see their trunks arching in the woodsYears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hairBefore them over their heads to dry in the sun.But I was going to say when Truth broke inWith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,I should prefer to have some boy bend themAs he went out and in to fetch the cows- Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,Whose only play was what he found himself,Summer or winter, and could play alone.One by one he subdued his father's treesBy riding them down over and over againUntil he took the stiffness out of them,And not one but hung limp, not one was leftFor him to conquer. He learned all there wasTo learn about not launching out too soonAnd so not carrying the tree awayClear to the ground. He always kept his poiseTo the top branches, climbing carefullyWith the same pains you use to fill a cupUp to the brim, and even above the brim.Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.So was I once myself a swinger of birches.And so I dream of going back to be.It's when I'm weary of considerations,And life is too much like a pathless woodWhere your face burns and tickles with the cobwebsBroken across it, and one eye is weepingFrom a twig's having lashed across it open.I'd like to get away from earth awhileAnd then come back to it and begin over.May no fate willfully misunderstand meAnd half grant what I wish and snatch me awayNot to return. Earth's the right place for love:I don't know where it's likely to go better.I'd like to go by climbing a birch treeAnd climb black branches up a snow-white trunkToward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,But dipped its top and set me down again.That would be good both going and coming back.One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf i can't do what i want to do then my job is to not do what i don't want to doIt's not the same thing but it's the best i can doIf i can't have what i want . . . then my job is to want what i've got and be satisfied that at least there is something more to wantSince i can't go where i need to go . . . then i must . . . go where the signs point through always understanding parallel movement isn't lateralWhen i can't express what i really feel i practice feeling what i can express and none of it is equalI know but that's why mankind alone among the animals learns to cry\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe memory of you emerges from the night around me.The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one! Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.In you the wars and the flights accumulated.From you the wings of the song birds rose.You swallowed everything, like distance.Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank! It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank! In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.Lost discoverer, in you everything sank! You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,sadness stunned you, in you everything sank! I made the wall of shadow draw back,beyond desire and act, I walked on.Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.There was the black solitude of the islands,and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain mein the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms! How terrible and brief my desire was to you! How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.Oh the mad coupling of hope and forcein which we merged and despaired.And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.And the word scarcely begun on the lips.This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank! Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned! From billow to billow you still called and sang.Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,lost discoverer, in you everything sank! It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hourwhich the night fastens to all the timetables.The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\ti like for you to be stillit is as though you are absentAnd you hear me from far awayAnd my voice does not touch youit seems as though your eyes had flown awayAnd it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouthAs all things are filled with my soulYou emerge from the thingsFilled with my soulYou are like my soulA butterfly of dreamAnd you are like the word: Melancholyi like for you to be stillAnd you seem far awayit sounds as though you are lamentingA butterfly cooing like a doveAnd you hear me from far awayAnd my voice does not reach youLet me come to be still in your silenceAnd let me talk to you with your silenceThat is bright as a lampSimple, as a ringYou are like the nightWith its stillness and constellationsYour silence is that of a starAs remote and candidi like for you to be stillit is as though you are absentDistant and full of sorrowSo you would've diedOne word then, One smile is enoughAnd i'm happy;Happy that it's not true\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\twe are always askedto understand the other person'sviewpointno matter howout-datedfoolish orobnoxious.one is askedto viewtheir total errortheir life-wastewithkindliness,especially if they areaged.but age is the total ofour doing.they have agedbadlybecause they havelivedout of focus,they have refused tosee.not their fault?whose fault?mine?I am asked to hidemy viewpointfrom themfor fear of theirfear.age is no crimebut the shameof a deliberatelywastedlifeamong so manydeliberatelywastedlivesis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOh, but it is dirty!--this little filling station,oil-soaked, oil-permeatedto a disturbing, over-allblack translucency.Be careful with that match!Father wears a dirty,oil-soaked monkey suitthat cuts him under the arms,and several quick and saucyand greasy sons assist him(it's a family filling station),all quite thoroughly dirty.Do they live in the station?It has a cement porchbehind the pumps, and on ita set of crushed and grease-impregnated wickerwork;on the wicker sofaa dirty dog, quite comfy.Some comic books providethe only note of color--of certain color.

Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd: Their's not to make reply, Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of Hell Rode the six hundred. Flash'd all their sabres bare, Flash'd as they turn'd in air Sabring the gunners there, Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd: Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro' the line they broke; Cossack and Russian Reel'd from the sabre-stroke Shatter'd and sunder'd. Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred. Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon behind them Volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, While horse and hero fell, They that had fought so well Came thro' the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of Hell, All that was left of them, Left of six hundred. When can their glory fade ? O the wild charge they made! All the world wonder'd. Honour the charge they made!

They know not I knew thee,  Who knew thee so well-- Long, long I shall rue thee,  Too deeply to tell. In secret we met--  In silence I grieve, That thy heart could forget,  Thy spirit deceive If I should meet thee  After long years, How should I greet thee?--  With silence and tears.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour life is your lifedon't let it be clubbed into dank submission.be on the watch.there are ways out.there is a light somewhere.it may not be much light butit beats the darkness.be on the watch.the gods will offer you chances.know them.take them.you can't beat death butyou can beat death in life, sometimes.and the more often you learn to do it,the more light there will be.your life is your life.know it while you have it.you are marvelousthe gods wait to delightin you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo the solemn sea the old women come With their shawls knotted around their necks With their fragile feet cracking. They sit down alone on the shore Without moving their eyes or their hands Without changing the clouds or the silence. The obscene sea breaks and claws Rushes downhill trumpeting Shakes its bull's beard. The gentle old ladies seated As if in a transparent boat They look at the terrorist waves. Where will they go and where have they been? They come from every corner They come from our own lives. Now they have the ocean The cold and burning emptiness The solitude full of flames. They come from all the pasts From houses which were fragrant From burnt-up evenings. They look, or don't look, at the sea With their walking sticks they draw signs in the sand And the sea erases their calligraphy. The old women get up and go away With their fragile bird feet While the waves flood in Traveling naked in the wind.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI do not think of you lying in the wet clayOf a Monaghan graveyard; I seeYou walking down a lane among the poplarsOn your way to the station, or happilyGoing to second Mass on a summer Sunday -You meet me and you say:'Don't forget to see about the cattle - 'Among your earthiest words the angels stray.And I think of you walking along a headlandOf green oats in June,So full of repose, so rich with life -And I see us meeting at the end of a townOn a fair day by accident, afterThe bargains are all made and we can walkTogether through the shops and stalls and marketsFree in the oriental streets of thought.O you are not lying in the wet clay,For it is a harvest evening now and weAre piling up the ricks against the moonlightAnd you smile up at us - eternally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI remember the night my motherwas stung by a scorpion. Ten hoursof steady rain had driven himto crawl beneath a sack of rice.Parting with his poison - flash of diabolic tail in the dark room -he risked the rain again.The peasants came like swarms of flies and buzzed the name of God a hundred times to paralyse the Evil One.With candles and with lanterns throwing giant scorpion shadows on the mud-baked wallsthey searched for him: he was not found.They clicked their tongues.With every movement that the scorpion made his poison moved in Mother's blood, they said.May he sit still, they saidMay the sins of your previous birth be burned away tonight, they said.May your suffering decrease the misfortunes of your next birth, they said.May the sum of all evil balanced in this unreal worldagainst the sum of goodbecome diminished by your pain.May the poison purify your fleshof desire, and your spirit of ambition,they said, and they sat aroundon the floor with my mother in the centre,the peace of understanding on each face.More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,more insects, and the endless rain.My mother twisted through and through,groaning on a mat.My father, sceptic, rationalist,trying every curse and blessing,powder, mixture, herb and hybrid.He even poured a little paraffinupon the bitten toe and put a match to it.I watched the flame feeding on my mother.I watched the holy man perform his rites to tame the poison with an incantation.After twenty hours it lost its sting.My mother only said Thank God the scorpion picked on meAnd spared my children.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe world is full of womenwho'd tell me I should be ashamed of myselfif they had the chance. Quit dancing.Get some self-respectand a day job.Right. And minimum wage,and varicose veins, just standingin one place for eight hoursbehind a glass counterbundled up to the neck, instead of naked as a meat sandwich.Selling gloves, or something.Instead of what I do sell.You have to have talent to peddle a thing so nebulousand without material form.Exploited, they'd say. Yes, any wayyou cut it, but I've a choiceof how, and I'll take the money.I do give value.Like preachers, I sell vision,like perfume ads, desireor its facsimile. Like jokesor war, it's all in the timing.I sell men back their worse suspicions:that everything's for sale,and piecemeal. They gaze at me and seea chain-saw murder just before it happens,when thigh, ass, inkblot, crevice, tit, and nippleare still connected.Such hatred leaps in them,my beery worshippers! That, or a blearyhopeless love. Seeing the rows of heads and upturned eyes, imploringbut ready to snap at my ankles,I understand floods and earthquakes, and the urge to step on ants. I keep the beat,and dance for them becausethey can't. The music smells like foxes,crisp as heated metalsearing the nostrilsor humid as August, hazy and languorousas a looted city the day after,when all the rape's been donealready, and the killing,and the survivors wander aroundlooking for garbageto eat, and there's only a bleak exhaustion.Speaking of which, it's the smilingtires me out the most. This, and the pretencethat I can't hear them.And I can't, because I'm after alla foreigner to them.The speech here is all warty gutturals,obvious as a slab of ham,but I come from the province of the godswhere meanings are lilting and oblique.I don't let on to everyone,but lean close, and I'll whisper:My mother was raped by a holy swan.You believe that? You can take me out to dinner. That's what we tell all the husbands.There sure are a lot of dangerous birds around.Not that anyone herebut you would understand.The rest of them would like to watch meand feel nothing. Reduce me to componentsas in a clock factory or abattoir.Crush out the mystery.Wall me up alivein my own body. They'd like to see through me, but nothing is more opaquethan absolute transparency.Look--my feet don't hit the marble!Like breath or a balloon, I'm rising,I hover six inches in the airin my blazing swan-egg of light.You think I'm not a goddess?Try me.This is a torch song.Touch me and you'll burn.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are holes in the skyWhere the rain gets inBut there ever so smallThat's why the rain is thin.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyou are the onei am lit for.Come with your rodthat twistsand is a serpent.i am the bush.i am burningi am not consumed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ring is on my hand,         And the wreath is on my brow;       Satin and jewels grand       Are all at my command,         And I am happy now.       And my lord he loves me well;         But, when first he breathed his vow,       I felt my bosom swell-       For the words rang as a knell,       And the voice seemed his who fell       In the battle down the dell,         And who is happy now.       But he spoke to re-assure me,         And he kissed my pallid brow,       While a reverie came o'er me,       And to the church-yard bore me,       And I sighed to him before me,       Thinking him dead D'Elormie,       \"Oh, I am happy now!\"       And thus the words were spoken,         And this the plighted vow,       And, though my faith be broken,       And, though my heart be broken,       Here is a ring, as token         That I am happy now!       Would God I could awaken!         For I dream I know not how!       And my soul is sorely shaken       Lest an evil step be taken,-       Lest the dead who is forsaken         May not be happy now.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t575\"Heaven\" has different Signs—to me—Sometimes, I think that NoonIs but a symbol of the Place—And when again, at Dawn,A mighty look runs round the WorldAnd settles in the Hills—An Awe if it should be like thatUpon the Ignorance steals—The Orchard, when the Sun is on—The Triumph of the BirdsWhen they together Victory make—Some Carnivals of Clouds—The Rapture of a finished Day—Returning to the West—All these—remind us of the placeThat Men call \"paradise\"—Itself be fairer—we suppose—But how Ourself, shall beAdorned, for a Superior Grace—Not yet, our eyes can see—\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNgifisa sengathi ungangibhalela incwadi Incwadi yothando yesiZuluEsho ngemibalabala na ngamabalabala Axoxa indaba ejulile yemizwa nemicabango Idayimane, ngelo thando lweqinisoOmhlophe, ngowenhliziyo engenasiciIndilinga, ngoba olwethu kalunasiphethoOluhlaza-sasibhakabhaka, ngoba wena ucabanga ngamiUnxantathu, ngoba amazulu aphezulu Kanjalo nomhlaba nolwandle ngaphansi bayazi Onsundu, ngoba kuyitshe kunothile futhi okwemveloNjengomhlabathi ongaphansi kwezinyawo zamiNoma ungawu shiya umbala ophuziKungani kumele ungithande ngenhliziyo enesikhwele! ?

In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, and out come Mrs. Prothero and the firemen.It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder.\"Fire!\" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, \"A fine Christmas!\" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper.\"Call the fire brigade,\" cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong.\"There won't be there,\" said Mr. Prothero, \"it's Christmas.\"There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting.\"Do something,\" he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box.\"Let's call the police as well,\" Jim said. \"And the ambulance.\" \"And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires.\"But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, \"Would you like anything to read?\"Years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the English and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed. But here a small boy says: \"It snowed last year, too. I made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea.\"\"But that was not the same snow,\" I say. \"Our snow was not only shaken from white wash buckets down the sky, it came shawling out of the ground and swam and drifted out of the arms and hands and bodies of the trees; snow grew overnight on the roofs of the houses like a pure and grandfather moss, minutely -ivied the walls and settled on the postman, opening the gate, like a dumb, numb thunder-storm of white, torn Christmas cards.\"\"Were there postmen then, too?\"\"With sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully. But all that the children could hear was a ringing of bells.\"\"You mean that the postman went rat-a-tat-tat and the doors rang?\"\"I mean that the bells the children could hear were inside them.\"\"I only hear thunder sometimes, never bells.\"\"There were church bells, too.\"\"Inside them?\"\"No, no, no, in the bat-black, snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks. And they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea. It seemed that all the churches boomed for joy under my window; and the weathercocks crew for Christmas, on our fence.\"\"Get back to the postmen\"\"They were just ordinary postmen, found of walking and dogs and Christmas and the snow. They knocked on the doors with blue knuckles ....\"\"Ours has got a black knocker....\"\"And then they stood on the white Welcome mat in the little, drifted porches and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot like small boys wanting to go out.\"\"And then the presents?\"\"And then the Presents, after the Christmas box. And the cold postman, with a rose on his button-nose, tingled down the tea-tray-slithered run of the chilly glinting hill. He went in his ice-bound boots like a man on fishmonger's slabs. \"He wagged his bag like a frozen camel's hump, dizzily turned the corner on one foot, and, by God, he was gone.\"\"Get back to the Presents.\"\"There were the Useful Presents: engulfing mufflers of the old coach days, and mittens made for giant sloths; zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes; blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes; from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all; and once I had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now, alas, no longer whinnying with us. And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles' pond and did and drowned; and books that told me everything about the wasp, except why.\"\"Go on the Useless Presents.\"\"Bags of moist and many-colored jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram-conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell; never a catapult; once, by mistake that no one could explain, a little hatchet; and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow; and a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased, and still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red field under the rainbow-billed and pea-green birds. Hardboileds, toffee, fudge and allsorts, crunches, cracknels, humbugs, glaciers, marzipan, and butterwelsh for the Welsh. And troops of bright tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run. And Snakes-and-Families and Happy Ladders. And Easy Hobbi-Games for Little Engineers, complete with instructions. Oh, easy for Leonardo! And a whistle to make the dogs bark to wake up the old man next door to make him beat on the wall with his stick to shake our picture off the wall. And a packet of cigarettes: you put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours, in vain, for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette, and then with a smirk you ate it. And then it was breakfast under the balloons.\"\"Were there Uncles like in our house?\"\"There are always Uncles at Christmas. The same Uncles. And on Christmas morning, with dog-disturbing whistle and sugar fags, I would scour the swatched town for the news of the little world, and find always a dead bird by the Post Office or by the white deserted swings; perhaps a robin, all but one of his fires out. Men and women wading or scooping back from chapel, with taproom noses and wind-bussed cheeks, all albinos, huddles their stiff black jarring feathers against the irreligious snow. Mistletoe hung from the gas brackets in all the front parlors; there was sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessertspoons; and cats in their fur-abouts watched the fires; and the high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the mulling pokers. Some few large men sat in the front parlors, without their collars, Uncles almost certainly, trying their new cigars, holding them out judiciously at arms' length, returning them to their mouths, coughing, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion; and some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, nor anywhere else for that matter, sat on the very edge of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break, like faded cups and saucers.\"Not many those mornings trod the piling streets: an old man always, fawn-bowlered, yellow-gloved and, at this time of year, with spats of snow, would take his constitutional to the white bowling green and back, as he would take it wet or fire on Christmas Day or Doomsday; sometimes two hale young men, with big pipes blazing, no overcoats and wind blown scarfs, would trudge, unspeaking, down to the forlorn sea, to work up an appetite, to blow away the fumes, who knows, to walk into the waves until nothing of them was left but the two furling smoke clouds of their inextinguishable briars. Then I would be slap-dashing home, the gravy smell of the dinners of others, the bird smell, the brandy, the pudding and mince, coiling up to my nostrils, when out of a snow-clogged side lane would come a boy the spit of myself, with a pink-tipped cigarette and the violet past of a black eye, cocky as a bullfinch, leering all to himself.I hated him on sight and sound, and would be about to put my dog whistle to my lips and blow him off the face of Christmas when suddenly he, with a violet wink, put his whistle to his lips and blew so stridently, so high, so exquisitely loud, that gobbling faces, their cheeks bulged with goose, would press against their tinsled windows, the whole length of the white echoing street. For dinner we had turkey and blazing pudding, and after dinner the Uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and slept. Mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro, bearing tureens. Auntie Bessie, who had already been frightened, twice, by a clock-work mouse, whimpered at the sideboard and had some elderberry wine. The dog was sick. Auntie Dosie had to have three aspirins, but Auntie Hannah, who liked port, stood in the middle of the snowbound back yard, singing like a big-bosomed thrush. I would blow up balloons to see how big they would blow up to; and, when they burst, which they all did, the Uncles jumped and rumbled. In the rich and heavy afternoon, the Uncles breathing like dolphins and the snow descending, I would sit among festoons and Chinese lanterns and nibble dates and try to make a model man-o'-war, following the Instructions for Little Engineers, and produce what might be mistaken for a sea-going tramcar.Or I would go out, my bright new boots squeaking, into the white world, on to the seaward hill, to call on Jim and Dan and Jack and to pad through the still streets, leaving huge footprints on the hidden pavements.\"I bet people will think there's been hippos.\"\"What would you do if you saw a hippo coming down our street?\"\"I'd go like this, bang! I'd throw him over the railings and roll him down the hill and then I'd tickle him under the ear and he'd wag his tail.\"\"What would you do if you saw two hippos?\"Iron-flanked and bellowing he-hippos clanked and battered through the scudding snow toward us as we passed Mr. Daniel's house.\"Let's post Mr. Daniel a snow-ball through his letter box.\"\"Let's write things in the snow.\"\"Let's write, 'Mr. Daniel looks like a spaniel' all over his lawn.\"Or we walked on the white shore. \"Can the fishes see it's snowing?\"The silent one-clouded heavens drifted on to the sea. Now we were snow-blind travelers lost on the north hills, and vast dewlapped dogs, with flasks round their necks, ambled and shambled up to us, baying \"Excelsior.\" We returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare red fingers in the wheel-rutted snow and cat-called after us, their voices fading away, as we trudged uphill, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay. And then, at tea the recovered Uncles would be jolly; and the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave. Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year.Bring out the tall tales now that we told by the fire as the gaslight bubbled like a diver. Ghosts whooed like owls in the long nights when I dared not look over my shoulder; animals lurked in the cubbyhole under the stairs and the gas meter ticked. And I remember that we went singing carols once, when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets. At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house, and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night, each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand in case, and all of us too brave to say a word. The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves. We reached the black bulk of the house. \"What shall we give them? Hark the Herald?\"\"No,\" Jack said, \"Good King Wencelas. I'll count three.\" One, two three, and we began to sing, our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew. We stood close together, near the dark door. Good King Wencelas looked out On the Feast of Stephen ... And then a small, dry voice, like the voice of someone who has not spoken for a long time, joined our singing: a small, dry, eggshell voice from the other side of the door: a small dry voice through the keyhole. And when we stopped running we were outside our house; the front room was lovely; balloons floated under the hot-water-bottle-gulping gas; everything was good again and shone over the town.\"Perhaps it was a ghost,\" Jim said. \"Perhaps it was trolls,\" Dan said, who was always reading.\"Let's go in and see if there's any jelly left,\" Jack said. And we did that.Always on Christmas night there was music. An uncle played the fiddle, a cousin sang \"Cherry Ripe,\" and another uncle sang \"Drake's Drum.\" It was very warm in the little house. Auntie Hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine, sang a song about Bleeding Hearts and Death, and then another in which she said her heart was like a Bird's Nest; and then everybody laughed again; and then I went to bed. Looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight and the unending smoke-colored snow, I could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill and hear the music rising from them up the long, steady falling night. I turned the gas down, I got into bed. I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLet America be America again.Let it be the dream it used to be.Let it be the pioneer on the plainSeeking a home where he himself is free.(America never was America to me.)Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed--Let it be that great strong land of loveWhere never kings connive nor tyrants schemeThat any man be crushed by one above.(It never was America to me.)O, let my land be a land where LibertyIs crowned with no false patriotic wreath,But opportunity is real, and life is free,Equality is in the air we breathe.(There's never been equality for me,Nor freedom in this \"homeland of the free.\")Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?

The millions on relief today?The millions shot down when we strike?The millions who have nothing for our pay?For all the dreams we've dreamedAnd all the songs we've sungAnd all the hopes we've heldAnd all the flags we've hung,The millions who have nothing for our pay--Except the dream that's almost dead today.O, let America be America again--The land that never has been yet--And yet must be--the land where every man is free.The land that's mine--the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME--Who made America,Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,Must bring back our mighty dream again.Sure, call me any ugly name you choose--The steel of freedom does not stain.From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,We must take back our land again,America!O, yes,I say it plain,America never was America to me,And yet I swear this oath--America will be!Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,We, the people, must redeemThe land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.The mountains and the endless plain--All, all the stretch of these great green states--And make America again!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout the size of an old-style dollar bill,American or Canadian,mostly the same whites, gray greens, and steel grays-this little painting (a sketch for a larger one?)has never earned any money in its life.Useless and free., it has spent seventy yearsas a minor family relic handed along collaterally to ownerswho looked at it sometimes, or didn't bother to.It must be Nova Scotia; only theredoes one see abled wooden housespainted that awful shade of brown.The other houses, the bits that show, are white.Elm trees., low hills, a thin church steeple-that gray-blue wisp-or is it?

We both knew this place,apparently, this literal small backwater,looked at it long enough to memorize it,our years apart. How strange. And it's still loved,or its memory is (it must have changed a lot).Our visions coincided-\"visions\" istoo serious a word-our looks, two looks:art \"copying from life\" and life itself,life and the memory of it so compressedthey've turned into each other. Which is which?Life and the memory of it cramped,dim, on a piece of Bristol board,dim, but how live, how touching in detail-the little that we get for free,the little of our earthly trust. Not much.About the size of our abidancealong with theirs: the munching cows,the iris, crisp and shivering, the waterstill standing from spring freshets,the yet-to-be-dismantled elms, the geese.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe moon in the bureau mirrorlooks out a million miles(and perhaps with pride, at herself,but she never, never smiles)far and away beyond sleep, orperhaps she's a daytime sleeper.By the Universe deserted,she'd tell it to go to hell,and she'd find a body of water,or a mirror, on which to dwell.So wrap up care in a cobweband drop it down the wellinto that world invertedwhere left is always right,where the shadows are really the body,where we stay awake all night,where the heavens are shallow as the seais now deep, and you love me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t480\"Why do I love\" You, Sir?Because—The Wind does not require the GrassTo answer—Wherefore when He passShe cannot keep Her place.Because He knows—andDo not You—And We know not—Enough for UsThe Wisdom it be so—The Lightning—never asked an EyeWherefore it shut—when He was by—Because He knows it cannot speak—And reasons not contained——Of Talk—There be—preferred by Daintier Folk—The Sunrise—Sire—compelleth Me—Because He's Sunrise—and I see—Therefore—Then—I love Thee—\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd because love battlesnot only in its burning agriculturesbut also in the mouth of men and women,I will finish off by taking the path awayto those who between my chest and your fragrancewant to interpose their obscure plant.About me, nothing worsethey will tell you, my love,than what I told you.I lived in the prairiesbefore I got to know youand I did not wait love but I waslaying in wait for and I jumped on the rose.What more can they tell you?I am neither good nor bad but a man,and they will then associate the dangerof my life, which you knowand which with your passion you shared.And good, this dangeris danger of love, of complete lovefor all life,for all lives,and if this love brings usthe death and the prisons,I am sure that your big eyes,as when I kiss them,will then close with pride,into double pride, love,with your pride and my pride.But to my ears they will come beforeto wear down the tourof the sweet and hard love which binds us,and they will say: “The oneyou love,is not a woman for you,Why do you love her? I thinkyou could find one more beautiful,more serious, more deep,more other, you understand me, look how she’s light,and what a head she has,and look at how she dresses,and etcetera and etcetera”.And I in these lines say:Like this I want you, love,love, Like this I love you,as you dressand how your hair lifts upand how your mouth smiles,light as the waterof the spring upon the pure stones,Like this I love you, beloved.To bread I do not ask to teach mebut only not to lack during every day of life.I don’t know anything about light, from whereit comes nor where it goes,I only want the light to light up,I do not ask to the nightexplanations,I wait for it and it envelops me,And so you, bread and lightAnd shadow are.You came to my lifewith what you were bringing,madeof light and bread and shadow I expected you,and Like this I need you,Like this I love you,and to those who want to hear tomorrowthat which I will not tell them, let them read it here,and let them back off today because it is earlyfor these arguments.Tomorrow we will only give thema leaf of the tree of our love, a leafwhich will fall on the earthlike if it had been made by our lipslike a kiss which fallsfrom our invincible heightsto show the fire and the tendernessof a true love.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo Vivian SmithA child one summer's evening soakeda glass jar in the reeling sunhoping to keep, when day was doneand all the sun's disciples cloakedin dream and darkness from his passion fled,this host, this pulse of light beside his bed.Wrapped in a scarf his monstrance stoodready to bless, to exorcizemonsters that whispering would risenightly from the intricate woodthat ringed his bed, to light with total powerthe holy commonplace of field and flower.He slept.

Pincer and claw,trident and vampire fang, envenomedwith his most secret hate, reached and came nearto pierce him in the thicket of his fear.He woke, recalled his jar of light,and trembling reached one hand to gropethe mantling scarf away. Then hopefell headlong from its eagle height.Through the dark house he ran, sobbing his loss,to the last clearing that he dared not cross:the bedroom where his comforterlay in his rival's fast embraceand faithless would not turn her facefrom the gross violence done to her.Love's proud executants played from a scoreno child could read or realize.

The ball fell in my hand, it sang in the closed fist: Open Open Behold a gift designed to kill. Now in my dial of glass appears the soldier who is going to die. He smiles, and moves about in ways his mother knows, habits of his. The wires touch his face: I cry NOW. Death, like a familiar, hears And look, has made a man of dust of a man of flesh. This sorcery I do. Being damned, I am amused to see the centre of love diffused and the wave of love travel into vacancy. How easy it is to make a ghost. The weightless mosquito touches her tiny shadow on the stone, and with how like, how infinite a lightness, man and shadow meet. They fuse. A shadow is a man when the mosquito death approaches\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll day I hear the noise of waters Making moan, Sad as the sea-bird is when, going Forth alone, He hears the winds cry to the water's Monotone.

''Never visit someones home empty handed'', that's what Mum always said.Flowers are always freshest when laid in the morning dew, still, by noon's end, they'll be wilting in the summer-haze, laying still, decomposing...and my mind takes to thinkingjust how morbidly apropos, this gift be, as i knee-touch soft soil...place the spray by your stone.[Now peace can be defined in myriad waysBut i sware, that serenity had draped its veil, where i stood; And for the first time since their death, i sensed connection]So, i filled them both in, on the towns latest skinny; I could almost hear their voices upon the wind-whisps overhead; Took a look at my watch...and it was time to head home.Our time went by so quickly, did it not? Like breeze through branches... leafless.I really must leave, mortal duties, you know; God, I really miss you guys...Can you hear me? Yes, you're right,  time, and destiny still be my keepers.but i'll be back soon, to share more news and memories. Just the three of us...yes, we will! And as i head towards the black wrought iron gates, i look back at the sea, of greystone and crosses, and in a moment of self-pity, i shout to the sky: THIS IS IT? ! A sudden, stale mist tails me.....all the way home, follows me like a pestilent cat, gone stray.Made it back before noon,  walked in to the scentof tealeaf, and cinamon...voices of life.Tea and crumpets taste freshest, before noontime, and silk flowers on a table never wilt, decompose.Think i'll take a drive into town, do my chores and such.Take an alternate route, around Dawsonstills Bridge. Then again, in truth... does it really matter? You see Death will always find me, when it wants to. .......Written August 14th,2007.......Frank James Christopher Ryan, Jr.........................F. j.

I wish this all made sense, I wish I understood.Not having you here with me is tearing me up inside, but I can't stop thinking about you no matter how hard I try.You know how I feel about you, and I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you, but it's so hard to do when I can't even be next to you.Why does it got to be so complicated? Loving you feels so right, but at the same time, knowing I can't have you keeps me awake at night.I just want this to be simple, I just want you here with me, to look into your eyes, be held in your arms...then I'd truly be happy.Right now this distance between us is out of our control, but I'm still hoping one day soon, I'll get what I'm wishing for.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat Justice is a blind goddessIs a thing to which we black are wise:Her bandage hides two festering soresThat once perhaps were eyes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor to have survived European colonization for them worth a boastTo the first Australians we should drink a toastAnthropologists claim their ancestors reached the southern shores sixty thousand years agoAnd maybe even further back in time for of that how would they knowCaptain Cook's arrival brought them no joy but tearsIn twenty with two centuries of yearsThey are pushed to extinction's brink by the colonizing raceAnd in their own Country demoted to a minor placeFor two hundred and twenty years racism they have knownAnd respect to them it never has been shownTreated as second class citizens in their own HomelandThat does seem rather hard to understandThe first Australians their praises we should singAs a race they have survived and that is an amazing thing.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough every nook and every crannyThe wind blew in on poor old GrannyAround her knees, into each ear(And up nose as well, I fear)All through the night the wind grew worseIt nearly made the vicar curseThe top had fallen off the steepleJust missing him (and other people)It blew on man, it blew on beastIt blew on nun, it blew on priestIt blew the wig off Auntie Fanny-But most of all, it blew on Granny!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish into the air.    The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.    The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and shewears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.    But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king'spalace is.    It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsiplant stands.    The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the sevenimpassable seas.    There is none in the world who can find her but myself.    She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; herhair sweeps down upon the floor.    She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewelswill fall from her lips when she smiles.    But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in thecorner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.    When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, stepup to that terrace on the roof.    I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meettogether.    Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where thebarber in the story lives.    But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber inthe story lives.    It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsiplant stands.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI come from there and I have memories Born as mortals are, I have a mother And a house with many windows, I have brothers, friends, And a prison cell with a cold window. Mine is the wave, snatched by sea-gulls, I have my own view, And an extra blade of grass. Mine is the moon at the far edge of the words, And the bounty of birds, And the immortal olive tree. I walked this land before the swords Turned its living body into a laden table. I come from there. I render the sky unto her mother When the sky weeps for her mother. And I weep to make myself known To a returning cloud. I learnt all the words worthy of the court of blood So that I could break the rule. I learnt all the words and broke them up To make a single word: Homeland.....\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;   The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;   The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,   While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:       But O heart! heart! heart!         O the bleeding drops of red,           Where on the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.   O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;   Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;      10   For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;   For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;       Here Captain! dear father!         This arm beneath your head;           It is some dream that on the deck,             You've fallen cold and dead.   My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;   My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;   The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;   From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;      20       Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!         But I, with mournful tread,           Walk the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe west was getting out of gold,The breath of air had died of cold,When shoeing home across the white,I thought I saw a bird alight.In summer when I passed the placeI had to stop and lift my face;A bird with an angelic giftWas singing in it sweet and swift.No bird was singing in it now.A single leaf was on a bough,And that was all there was to seeIn going twice around the tree.From my advantage on a hillI judged that such a crystal chillWas only adding frost to snowAs gilt to gold that wouldn't show.A brush had left a crooked strokeOf what was either cloud or smokeFrom north to south across the blue;A piercing little star was through.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBefore man to blow to rightThe wind once blew itself untaught,And did its loudest day and nightIn any rough place where it caught. Man came to tell it what was wrong:It hadn't found the place to blow;It blew too hard - the aim was song.And listen - how it ought to go! He took a little in his mouth,And held it long enough for northTo be converted into south,And then by measure blew it forth. By measure. It was word and note,The wind the wind had meant to be -A little through the lips and throat.The aim was song - the wind could see.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDid the people of Viet Namuse lanterns of stone?Did they hold ceremoniesto reverence the opening of buds?Were they inclined to quiet laughter?Did they use bone and ivory,jade and silver, for ornament?Had they an epic poem?Did they distinguish between speech and singing?Sir, their light hearts turned to stone.It is not remembered whether in gardensstone gardens illumined pleasant ways.Perhaps they gathered once to delight in blossom,but after their children were killedthere were no more buds.Sir, laughter is bitter to the burned mouth.A dream ago, perhaps. Ornament is for joy.All the bones were charred.it is not remembered. Remember,most were peasants; their lifewas in rice and bamboo.When peaceful clouds were reflected in the paddiesand the water buffalo stepped surely along terraces,maybe fathers told their sons old tales.When bombs smashed those mirrorsthere was time only to scream.There is an echo yetof their speech which was like a song.It was reported their singing resembled the flight of moths in moonlight.Who can say? It is silent now.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWHERE the bee sucks, there suck I:\t  In a cowslip's bell I lie; \tThere I couch when owls do cry.\tOn the bat's back I do fly.\tAfter summer merrily:  Merrily, merrily, shall I live now  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCome with me, I said, and no one knewwhere, or how my pain throbbed,no carnations or barcaroles for me, only a wound that love had opened.I said it again: Come with me, as if I were dying,and no one saw the moon that bled in my mouthor the blood that rose into the silence.O Love, now we can forget the star that has such thorns!That is why when I heard your voice repeatCome with me, it was as if you had let loosethe grief, the love, the fury of a cork-trapped winethe geysers flooding from deep in its vault:in my mouth I felt the taste of fire again,of blood and carnations, of rock and scald.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOH, let’s go up the hill and scare ourselves, As reckless as the best of them to-night, By setting fire to all the brush we piled With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow. Oh, let’s not wait for rain to make it safe. The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough Down dark converging paths between the pines. Let’s not care what we do with it to-night. Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile The way we piled it. And let’s be the talk Of people brought to windows by a light Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper. Rouse them all, both the free and not so free With saying what they’d like to do to us For what they’d better wait till we have done. Let’s all but bring to life this old volcano, If that is what the mountain ever was— And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will….” “And scare you too?” the children said together. “Why wouldn’t it scare me to have a fire Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know That still, if I repent, I may recall it, But in a moment not: a little spurt Of burning fatness, and then nothing but The fire itself can put it out, and that By burning out, and before it burns out It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars, And sweeping round it with a flaming sword, Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle— Done so much and I know not how much more I mean it shall not do if I can bind it. Well if it doesn’t with its draft bring on A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter, As once it did with me upon an April. The breezes were so spent with winter blowing They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them Short of the perch their languid flight was toward; And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven As I walked once round it in possession. But the wind out of doors—you know the saying. There came a gust. You used to think the trees Made wind by fanning since you never knew It blow but that you saw the trees in motion. Something or someone watching made that gust. It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass Of over-winter with the least tip-touch Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand. The place it reached to blackened instantly. The black was all there was by day-light, That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke— And a flame slender as the hepaticas, Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now. But the black spread like black death on the ground, And I think the sky darkened with a cloud Like winter and evening coming on together. There were enough things to be thought of then. Where the field stretches toward the north And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it To flames without twice thinking, where it verges Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear They might find fuel there, in withered brake, Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod, And alder and grape vine entanglement, To leap the dusty deadline. For my own I took what front there was beside. I knelt And thrust hands in and held my face away. Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating. A board is the best weapon if you have it. I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew, And said out loud, I couldn’t bide the smother And heat so close in; but the thought of all The woods and town on fire by me, and all The town turned out to fight for me—that held me. I trusted the brook barrier, but feared The road would fail; and on that side the fire Died not without a noise of crackling wood— Of something more than tinder-grass and weed— That brought me to my feet to hold it back By leaning back myself, as if the reins Were round my neck and I was at the plough. I won! But I’m sure no one ever spread Another color over a tenth the space That I spread coal-black over in the time It took me. Neighbors coming home from town Couldn’t believe that so much black had come there While they had backs turned, that it hadn’t been there When they had passed an hour or so before Going the other way and they not seen it. They looked about for someone to have done it. But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering Where all my weariness had gone and why I walked so light on air in heavy shoes In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling. Why wouldn’t I be scared remembering that?” “If it scares you, what will it do to us?” “Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared, What would you say to war if it should come? That’s what for reasons I should like to know— If you can comfort me by any answer.” “Oh, but war’s not for children—it’s for men.” “Now we are digging almost down to China. My dears, my dears, you thought that—we all thought it. So your mistake was ours. Haven’t you heard, though, About the ships where war has found them out At sea, about the towns where war has come Through opening clouds at night with droning speed Further o’erhead than all but stars and angels,— And children in the ships and in the towns? Haven’t you heard what we have lived to learn? Nothing so new—something we had forgotten: War is for everyone, for children too. I wasn’t going to tell you and I mustn’t. The best way is to come up hill with me And have our fire and laugh and be afraid.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI ne'er was struck before that hour With love so sudden and so sweet, Her face it bloomed like a sweet flower And stole my heart away complete. My face turned pale as deadly pale. My legs refused to walk away, And when she looked, what could I ail? My life and all seemed turned to clay.And then my blood rushed to my face And took my eyesight quite away, The trees and bushes round the place Seemed midnight at noonday. I could not see a single thing, Words from my eyes did start -- They spoke as chords do from the string, And blood burnt round my heart.Are flowers the winter's choice? Is love's bed always snow? She seemed to hear my silent voice, Not love's appeals to know. I never saw so sweet a face As that I stood before. My heart has left its dwelling-place And can return no more\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day; And give us not to think so far away As the uncertain harvest; keep us here All simply in the springing of the year. Oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night; And make us happy in the happy bees, The swarm dilating round the perfect trees. And make us happy in the darting bird That suddenly above the bees is heard,The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill, And off a blossom in mid air stands still. For this is love and nothing else is love, The which it is reserved for God above To sanctify to what far ends He will,But which it only needs that we fulfil.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce upon a time a frogCroaked away in Bingle BogEvery night from dusk to dawnHe croaked awn and awn and awnOther creatures loathed his voice,But, alas, they had no choice,And the crass cacophonyBlared out from the sumac treeAt whose foot the frog each nightMinstrelled on till morning nightNeither stones nor prayers nor sticks.Insults or complaints or bricksStilled the frogs determinationTo display his heart's elation.But one night a nightingaleIn the moonlight cold and palePerched upon the sumac treeCasting forth her melodyDumbstruck sat the gaping frogAnd the whole admiring bogStared towards the sumac, rapt,And, when she had ended, clapped,Ducks had swum and herons wadedTo her as she serenadedAnd a solitary loonWept, beneath the summer moon.Toads and teals and tiddlers, capturedBy her voice, cheered on, enraptured:\"Bravo! \" \"Too divine! \" \"Encore! \"So the nightingale once more,Quite unused to such applause,Sang till dawn without a pause.Next night when the NightingaleShook her head and twitched her tail,Closed an eye and fluffed a wingAnd had cleared her throat to singShe was startled by a croak.\"Sorry - was that you who spoke? \"She enquired when the frogHopped towards her from the bog.\"Yes,\" the frog replied. \"You see,I'm the frog who owns this treeIn this bog I've long been knownFor my splendid baritoneAnd, of course, I wield my penFor Bog Trumpet now and then\"\"Did you… did you like my song? \"\"Not too bad - but far too long.The technique was fine of course,But it lacked a certain force\".\"Oh! \" the nightingale confessed.Greatly flattered and impressedThat a critic of such noteHad discussed her art and throat:\"I don't think the song's divine.But - oh, well - at least it's mine\".\"That's not much to boast about\".Said the heartless frog. \"WithoutProper training such as I- And few others can supply.You'll remain a mere beginner.But with me you'll be a winner\"\"Dearest frog\", the nightingaleBreathed: \"This is a fairy tale -And you are Mozart in disguiseCome to earth before my eyes\".\"Well I charge a modest fee.\"\"Oh! \" \"But it won't hurt, you'll see\"Now the nightingale inspired,Flushed with confidence, and firedWith both art and adoration,Sang - and was a huge sensation.Animals for miles aroundFlocked towards the magic sound,And the frog with great precisionCounted heads and charged admission.Though next morning it was raining,He began her vocal training.\"But I can't sing in this weather\"\"Come my dear - we'll sing together.Just put on your scarf and sash,Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"So the frog and nightingaleJourneyed up and down the scaleFor six hours, till she was shiveringand her voice was hoarse and quivering.Though subdued and sleep deprived,In the night her throat revived,And the sumac tree was bowed,With a breathless, titled crowd:Owl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent,Mallard and Milady Trent,Martin Cardinal Mephisto,And the Coot of Monte Cristo,Ladies with tiaras glitteringIn the interval sat twittering -And the frog observed them glitterWith a joy both sweet and bitter.Every day the frog who'd sold herSongs for silver tried to scold her:\"You must practice even longerTill your voice, like mine grows stronger.In the second song last nightYou got nervous in mid-flight.And, my dear, lay on more trills:Audiences enjoy such frills.You must make your public happier:Give them something sharper snappier.We must aim for better billings.You still owe me sixty shillings.\"Day by day the nightingaleGrew more sorrowful and pale.Night on night her tired songZipped and trilled and bounced along,Till the birds and beasts grew tiredAt a voice so uninspiredAnd the ticket office grossCrashed, and she grew more morose -For her ears were now addictedTo applause quite unrestricted,And to sing into the nightAll alone gave no delight.Now the frog puffed up with rage.\"Brainless bird - you're on the stage -Use your wits and follow fashion.Puff your lungs out with your passion.\"Trembling, terrified to fail,Blind with tears, the nightingaleHeard him out in silence, tried,Puffed up, burst a vein, and died.Said the frog: \"I tried to teach her,But she was a stupid creature -Far too nervous, far too tense.Far too prone to influence.Well, poor bird - she should have knownThat your song must be your own.That's why I sing with panache:\"Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"And the foghorn of the frogBlared unrivalled through the bog.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is blue-butterfly day here in spring,And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurryThere is more unmixed color on the wingThan flowers will show for days unless they hurry.But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:And now from having ridden out desireThey lie closed over in the wind and clingWhere wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t929How far is it to Heaven?As far as Death this way—Of River or of Ridge beyondWas no discovery.How far is it to Hell?As far as Death this way—How far left hand the SepulchreDefies Topography.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI marvel how Nature could ever find space For so many strange contrasts in one human face: There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom. There's weakness, and strength both redundant and vain; Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain Could pierce through a temper that's soft to disease, Would be rational peace--a philosopher's ease. There's indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds, And attention full ten times as much as there needs; Pride where there's no envy, there's so much of joy; And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy. There's freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she's there, There's virtue, the title it surely may claim, Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name. This picture from nature may seem to depart, Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart; And I for five centuries right gladly would be Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou who live secureIn your warm housesWho return at evening to findHot food and friendly faces:    Consider whether this is a man,    Who labours in the mud    Who knows no peace    Who fights for a crust of bread    Who dies at a yes or a no.    Consider whether this is a woman,    Without hair or name    With no more strength to remember    Eyes empty and womb cold    As a frog in winter.Consider that this has been:I commend these words to you.Engrave them on your heartsWhen you are in your house, when you walk on your way,When you go to bed, when you rise.Repeat them to your children.Or may your house crumble,Disease render you powerless,Your offspring avert their faces from you.Translated by Ruth Feldman And Brian SwannAnonymous submission.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShe is as in a field a silken tentAt midday when the sunny summer breezeHas dried the dew and all its ropes relent,So that in guys it gently sways at ease,And its supporting central cedar pole,That is its pinnacle to heavenwardAnd signifies the sureness of the soul,Seems to owe naught to any single cord,But strictly held by none, is loosely boundBy countless silken ties of love and thoughtTo every thing on earth the compass round,And only by one's going slightly tautIn the capriciousness of summer airIs of the slightlest bondage made aware.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll out of doors looked darkly in at himThrough the thin frost, almost in separate stars,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.What kept his eyes from giving back the gazeWas the lamp tilted near them in his hand.What kept him from remembering what it wasThat brought him to that creaking room was age.He stood with barrels round him -- at a loss.And having scared the cellar under himIn clomping there, he scared it once againIn clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roarOf trees and crack of branches, common things,But nothing so like beating on a box.A light he was to no one but himselfWhere now he sat, concerned with he knew what,A quiet light, and then not even that.He consigned to the moon, such as she was,So late-arising, to the broken moonAs better than the sun in any caseFor such a charge, his snow upon the roof,His icicles along the wall to keep;And slept. The log that shifted with a joltOnce in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.One aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,A farm, a countryside, or if he can,It's thus he does it of a winter night.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow can I keep my soul in me, so thatit doesn't touch your soul? How can I raiseit high enough, past you, to other things?I would like to shelter it, among remotelost objects, in some dark and silent placethat doesn't resonate when your depths resound.Yet everything that touches us, me and you,takes us together like a violin's bow,which draws *one* voice out of two separate strings.Upon what instrument are we two spanned?And what musician holds us in his hand?Oh sweetest song.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is the place.  Stand still, my steed,  Let me review the scene,And summon from the shadowy Past  The forms that once have been.The Past and Present here unite  Beneath Time's flowing tide,Like footprints hidden by a brook,  But seen on either side.Here runs the highway to the town;  There the green lane descends,Through which I walked to church with thee,  O gentlest of my friends!The shadow of the linden-trees  Lay moving on the grass;Between them and the moving boughs,  A shadow, thou didst pass.Thy dress was like the lilies,  And thy heart as pure as they:One of God's holy messengers  Did walk with me that day.I saw the branches of the trees  Bend down thy touch to meet,The clover-blossoms in the grass  Rise up to kiss thy feet,\"Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,  Of earth and folly born!\"Solemnly sang the village choir  On that sweet Sabbath morn.Through the closed blinds the golden sun  Poured in a dusty beam,Like the celestial ladder seen  By Jacob in his dream.And ever and anon, the wind,  Sweet-scented with the hay,Turned o'er the hymn-book's fluttering leaves That on the window lay.Long was the good man's sermon,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For he spake of Ruth the beautiful,  And still I thought of thee.Long was the prayer he uttered,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For in my heart I prayed with him,  And still I thought of thee.But now, alas! the place seems changed;  Thou art no longer here:Part of the sunshine of the scene  With thee did disappear.Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,  Like pine-trees dark and high,Subdue the light of noon, and breathe  A low and ceaseless sigh;This memory brightens o'er the past,  As when the sun, concealedBehind some cloud that near us hangs  Shines on a distant field.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe tree has entered my hands,The sap has ascended my arms,The tree has grown in my breast -Downward,The branches grow out of me, like arms.Tree you are,Moss you are,You are violets with wind above them.A child - so high - you are,And all this is folly to the world.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe sat in a wheeled chair, waiting for dark, And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey, Legless, sewn short at elbow. Through the park Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn, Voices of play and pleasure after day, Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him. About this time Town used to swing so gay When glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees, And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,- In the old times, before he threw away his knees. Now he will never feel again how slim Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands. All of them touch him like some queer disease. There was an artist silly for his face, For it was younger than his youth, last year. Now, he is old; his back will never brace; He's lost his colour very far from here, Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry, And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race And leap of purple spurted from his thigh. One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg, After the matches, carried shoulder-high. It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg, He thought he'd better join. - He wonders why. Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts, That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg, Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts He asked to join. He didn't have to beg; Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years. Germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt, And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes; And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears; Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits. And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers. Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal. Only a solemn man who brought him fruits Thanked him; and then enquired about his soul. Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes, And do what things the rules consider wise, And take whatever pity they may dole. Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes Passed from him to the strong men that were whole. How cold and late it is! Why don't they come And put him into bed? Why don't they come?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI WALKED down alone Sunday after churchTo the place where John has been cutting treesTo see for myself about the birchHe said I could have to bush my peas.The sun in the new-cut narrow gapWas hot enough for the first of May,And stifling hot with the odor of sapFrom stumps still bleeding their life away.The frogs that were peeping a thousand shrillWherever the ground was low and wet,The minute they heard my step went stillTo watch me and see what I came to get.Birch boughs enough piled everywhere!—All fresh and sound from the recent axe.Time someone came with cart and pairAnd got them off the wild flower's backs.They might be good for garden thingsTo curl a little finger round,The same as you seize cat's-cradle strings,And lift themselves up off the ground.Small good to anything growing wild,They were crooking many a trilliumThat had budded before the boughs were piledAnd since it was coming up had to come.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhenever Richard Cory went down town,We people on the pavement looked at him:He was a gentleman from sole to crown,Clean favored, and imperially slim.And he was always quietly arrayed,And he was always human when he talked; But still he fluttered pulses when he said,'Good-morning,' and he glittered when he walked.And he was rich - yes, richer than a king -And admirably schooled in every grace:In fine, we thought that he was everythingTo make us wish that we were in his place.So on we worked, and waited for the light,And went without the meat, and cursed the bread; And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,Went home and put a bullet through his head.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder the parabola of a ball, a child turning into a man, I looked into the air too long. The ball fell in my hand, it sang in the closed fist: Open Open Behold a gift designed to kill. Now in my dial of glass appears the soldier who is going to die. He smiles, and moves about in ways his mother knows, habits of his. The wires touch his face: I cry NOW. Death, like a familiar, hears And look, has made a man of dust of a man of flesh. This sorcery I do. Being damned, I am amused to see the centre of love diffused and the wave of love travel into vacancy. How easy it is to make a ghost. The weightless mosquito touches her tiny shadow on the stone, and with how like, how infinite a lightness, man and shadow meet. They fuse. A shadow is a man when the mosquito death approaches\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdamHad'em\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWho wants my jellyfish?I'm not sellyfish!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFlow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,    Thy tribute wave deliver:No more by thee my steps shall be,    For ever and for ever.Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,    A rivulet then a river:Nowhere by thee my steps shall be    For ever and for ever.But here will sigh thine alder tree    And here thine aspen shiver;And here by thee will hum the bee,    For ever and for ever.A thousand suns will stream on thee,    A thousand moons will quiver;But not by thee my steps shall be,    For ever and for ever.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you came, you were like red wine and honey, And the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness. Now you are like morning bread, Smooth and pleasant. I hardly taste you at all for I know your savour, But I am completely nourished.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome people forget that love is tucking you in and kissing you 'Good night' no matter how young or old you areSome people don't remember that love is listening and laughing and asking questions no matter what your ageFew recognize that love is commitment, responsibility no fun at all unlessLove is You and me\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTime that is moved by little fidget wheels Is not my time, the flood that does not flow. Between the double and the single bell Of a ship's hour, between a round of bells From the dark warship riding there below, I have lived many lives, and this one life Of Joe, long dead, who lives between five bells. Deep and dissolving verticals of light Ferry the falls of moonshine down. Five bells Coldly rung out in a machine's voice. Night and water Pour to one rip of darkness, the Harbour floats In the air, the Cross hangs upside-down in water. Why do I think of you, dead man, why thieve These profitless lodgings from the flukes of thought Anchored in Time? You have gone from earth, Gone even from the meaning of a name; Yet something's there, yet something forms its lips And hits and cries against the ports of space, Beating their sides to make its fury heard. Are you shouting at me, dead man, squeezing your face In agonies of speech on speechless panes? Cry louder, beat the windows, bawl your name! But I hear nothing, nothing...only bells, Five bells, the bumpkin calculus of Time. Your echoes die, your voice is dowsed by Life, There's not a mouth can fly the pygmy strait - Nothing except the memory of some bones Long shoved away, and sucked away, in mud; And unimportant things you might have done, Or once I thought you did; but you forgot, And all have now forgotten - looks and words And slops of beer; your coat with buttons off, Your gaunt chin and pricked eye, and raging tales Of Irish kings and English perfidy, And dirtier perfidy of publicans Groaning to God from Darlinghurst. Five bells. Then I saw the road, I heard the thunder Tumble, and felt the talons of the rain The night we came to Moorebank in slab-dark, So dark you bore no body, had no face, But a sheer voice that rattled out of air (As now you'd cry if I could break the glass), A voice that spoke beside me in the bush, Loud for a breath or bitten off by wind, Of Milton, melons, and the Rights of Man, And blowing flutes, and how Tahitian girls Are brown and angry-tongued, and Sydney girls Are white and angry-tongued, or so you'd found. But all I heard was words that didn't join So Milton became melons, melons girls, And fifty mouths, it seemed, were out that night, And in each tree an Ear was bending down, Or something that had just run, gone behind the grass, When blank and bone-white, like a maniac's thought, The naphtha-flash of lightning slit the sky, Knifing the dark with deathly photographs. There's not so many with so poor a purse Or fierce a need, must fare by night like that, Five miles in darkness on a country track, But when you do, that's what you think. Five bells. In Melbourne, your appetite had gone, Your angers too; they had been leeched away By the soft archery of summer rains And the sponge-paws of wetness, the slow damp That stuck the leaves of living, snailed the mind, And showed your bones, that had been sharp with rage, The sodden ectasies of rectitude. I thought of what you'd written in faint ink, Your journal with the sawn-off lock, that stayed behind With other things you left, all without use, All without meaning now, except a sign That someone had been living who now was dead: \"At Labassa. Room 6 x 8 On top of the tower; because of this, very dark And cold in winter. Everything has been stowed Into this room - 500 books all shapes And colours, dealt across the floor And over sills and on the laps of chairs; Guns, photoes of many differant things And differant curioes that I obtained...\" In Sydney, by the spent aquarium-flare Of penny gaslight on pink wallpaper, We argued about blowing up the world, But you were living backward, so each night You crept a moment closer to the breast, And they were living, all of them, those frames And shapes of flesh that had perplexed your youth, And most your father, the old man gone blind, With fingers always round a fiddle's neck, That graveyard mason whose fair monuments And tablets cut with dreams of piety Rest on the bosoms of a thousand men Staked bone by bone, in quiet astonishment At cargoes they had never thought to bear, These funeral-cakes of sweet and sculptured stone. Where have you gone? The tide is over you, The turn of midnight water's over you, As Time is over you, and mystery, And memory, the flood that does not flow. You have no suburb, like those easier dead In private berths of dissolution laid - The tide goes over, the waves ride over you And let their shadows down like shining hair, But they are Water; and the sea-pinks bend Like lilies in your teeth, but they are Weed; And you are only part of an Idea. I felt the wet push its black thumb-balls in, The night you died, I felt your eardrums crack, And the short agony, the longer dream, The Nothing that was neither long nor short; But I was bound, and could not go that way, But I was blind, and could not feel your hand. If I could find an answer, could only find Your meaning, or could say why you were here Who now are gone, what purpose gave you breath Or seized it back, might I not hear your voice? I looked out my window in the dark At waves with diamond quills and combs of light That arched their mackerel-backs and smacked the sand In the moon's drench, that straight enormous glaze, And ships far off asleep, and Harbour-buoys Tossing their fireballs wearily each to each, And tried to hear your voice, but all I heard Was a boat's whistle, and the scraping squeal Of seabirds' voices far away, and bells, Five bells. Five bells coldly ringing out. Five bells.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wrote a good omelet...and ate a hot poem... after loving youButtoned my car...and drove my coat home...in the rain... after loving youI goed on red...and stopped on green...floating somewhere in between... being here and being there... after loving youI rolled my bed...turned down my hair...slightly confused but...I don't care...Laid out my teeth...and gargled my gown...then I stood ...and laid me down...To sleep... after loving you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI went down to the river,I set down on the bank.I tried to think but couldn't,So I jumped in and sank.I came up once and hollered!I came up twice and cried!If that water hadn't a-been so coldI might've sunk and died.But it was Cold in that water! It was cold!I took the elevatorSixteen floors above the ground.I thought about my babyAnd thought I would jump down.I stood there and I hollered!I stood there and I cried!If it hadn't a-been so highI might've jumped and died.But it was High up there! It was high!So since I'm still here livin',I guess I will live on.I could've died for love--But for livin' I was bornThough you may hear me holler,And you may see me cry--I'll be dogged, sweet baby,If you gonna see me die.Life is fine! Fine as wine! Life is fine!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA tree's leaves may be ever so good,So may its bar, so may its wood;But unless you put the right thing to its rootIt never will show much flower or fruit.But I may be one who does not careEver to have tree bloom or bear.Leaves for smooth and bark for rough,Leaves and bark may be tree enough.Some giant trees have bloom so smallThey might as well have none at all.Late in life I have come on fern.Now lichens are due to have their turn.I bade men tell me which in brief,Which is fairer, flower or leaf.They did not have the wit to say,Leaves by night and flowers by day.Leaves and bar, leaves and bark,To lean against and hear in the dark.Petals I may have once pursued.Leaves are all my darker mood.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe ivory gods,And the ebony gods,And the gods of diamond and jade,Sit silently on their temple shelvesWhile the people Are afraid.Yet the ivory gods,And the ebony gods,And the gods of diamond-jade,Are only silly puppet godsThat the people themselvesHave made.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLate August, given heavy rain and sunFor a full week, the blackberries would ripen.At first, just one, a glossy purple clotAmong others, red, green, hard as a knot.You ate that first one and its flesh was sweetLike thickened wine: summer's blood was in itLeaving stains upon the tongue and lust forPicking. Then red ones inked up and that hungerSent us out with milk cans, pea tins, jam-potsWhere briars scratched and wet grass bleached our boots.Round hayfields, cornfields and potato-drillsWe trekked and picked until the cans were fullUntil the tinkling bottom had been coveredWith green ones, and on top big dark blobs burnedLike a plate of eyes. Our hands were pepperedWith thorn pricks, our palms sticky as Bluebeard's.We hoarded the fresh berries in the byre.But when the bath was filled we found a fur,A rat-grey fungus, glutting on our cache.The juice was stinking too. Once off the bushThe fruit fermented, the sweet flesh would turn sour.I always felt like crying. It wasn't fairThat all the lovely canfuls smelt of rot.Each year I hoped they'd keep, knew they would not.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMary, Mary, quite contraryHow does your garden grow?'I live with my brat in a high-rise flat,So how in the world would I know.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t101Will there really be a \"Morning\"?Is there such a thing as \"Day\"?Could I see it from the mountainsIf I were as tall as they?Has it feet like Water lilies?Has it feathers like a Bird?Is it brought from famous countriesOf which I have never heard?Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor!Oh some Wise Men from the skies!Please to tell a little PilgrimWhere the place called \"Morning\" lies!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHer scarf a la Bardot, In suede flats for the walk, She came with me one eveningFor air and friendly talk.We crossed the quiet river, Took the embankment walk.Traffic holding its breath, Sky a tense diaphragm: Dusk hung like a backclothThat shook where a swan swam, Tremulous as a hawkHanging deadly, calm.A vacuum of needCollapsed each hunting heartBut tremulously we heldAs hawk and prey apart, Preserved classic decorum, Deployed our talk with art.Our JuveniliaHad taught us both to wait, Not to publish feelingAnd regret it all too late -Mushroom loves alreadyHad puffed and burst in hate.So, chary and excited, As a thrush linked on a hawk, We thrilled to the March twilightWith nervous childish talk: Still waters running deepAlong the embankment walk.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe memory of you emerges from the night around me.The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one! Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.In you the wars and the flights accumulated.From you the wings of the song birds rose.You swallowed everything, like distance.Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank! It was the happy hour of assault and the kiss.The hour of the spell that blazed like a lighthouse.Pilot's dread, fury of blind driver,turbulent drunkenness of love, in you everything sank! In the childhood of mist my soul, winged and wounded.Lost discoverer, in you everything sank! You girdled sorrow, you clung to desire,sadness stunned you, in you everything sank! I made the wall of shadow draw back,beyond desire and act, I walked on.Oh flesh, my own flesh, woman whom I loved and lost,I summon you in the moist hour, I raise my song to you.Like a jar you housed infinite tenderness.and the infinite oblivion shattered you like a jar.There was the black solitude of the islands,and there, woman of love, your arms took me in.There was thirst and hunger, and you were the fruit.There were grief and ruins, and you were the miracle.Ah woman, I do not know how you could contain mein the earth of your soul, in the cross of your arms! How terrible and brief my desire was to you! How difficult and drunken, how tensed and avid.Cemetery of kisses, there is still fire in your tombs,still the fruited boughs burn, pecked at by birds.Oh the bitten mouth, oh the kissed limbs,oh the hungering teeth, oh the entwined bodies.Oh the mad coupling of hope and forcein which we merged and despaired.And the tenderness, light as water and as flour.And the word scarcely begun on the lips.This was my destiny and in it was my voyage of my longing,and in it my longing fell, in you everything sank! Oh pit of debris, everything fell into you,what sorrow did you not express, in what sorrow are you not drowned! From billow to billow you still called and sang.Standing like a sailor in the prow of a vessel.You still flowered in songs, you still brike the currents.Oh pit of debris, open and bitter well.Pale blind diver, luckless slinger,lost discoverer, in you everything sank! It is the hour of departure, the hard cold hourwhich the night fastens to all the timetables.The rustling belt of the sea girdles the shore.Cold stars heave up, black birds migrate.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.Only tremulous shadow twists in my hands.Oh farther than everything. Oh farther than everything.It is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHey diddle diddleWe're all on the fiddleAnd never get up until noon.We only take cashWhich we carefully stashAnd we work by the light of the moon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHere come real stars to fill the upper skies, And here on earth come emulating flies, That though they never equal stars in size, (And they were never really stars at heart) Achieve at times a very star-like start.

The court fell silent.The king looked like Munch's ScreamFairies' prophecies, in times like those, held water.However the twelfth fairyhad a certain kind of eraserand thus she mitigated the cursechanging that deathinto a hundred-year sleep.The king ordered every spinning wheelexterminated and exorcised.Briar Rose grew to be a goddessand each night the kingbit the hem of her gownto keep her safe.He fastened the moon upwith a safety pinto give her perpetual lightHe forced every male in the courtto scour his tongue with Bab-olest they poison the air she dwelt in.Thus she dwelt in his odor.Rank as honeysuckle.On her fifteenth birthdayshe pricked her fingeron a charred spinning wheeland the clocks stopped.Yes indeed. She went to sleep.The king and queen went to sleep, the courtiers, the flies on the wall.The fire in the hearth grew stilland the roast meat stopped crackling.The trees turned into metaland the dog became china.They all lay in a trance, each a catatonicstuck in a time machine.Even the frogs were zombies.Only a bunch of briar roses grewforming a great wall of tacksaround the castle.Many princestried to get through the bramblesfor they had heard much of Briar Rosebut they had not scoured their tonguesso they were held by the thornsand thus were crucified.In due timea hundred years passedand a prince got through.The briars parted as if for Mosesand the prince found the tableau intact.He kissed Briar Roseand she woke up crying: Daddy! Daddy! Presto! She's out of prison! She married the princeand all went wellexcept for the fear -the fear of sleep.Briar Rosewas an insomniac...She could not napor lie in sleepwithout the court chemistmixing her some knock-out dropsand never in the prince's presence.If if is to come, she said, sleep must take me unawareswhile I am laughing or dancingso that I do not know that brutal placewhere I lie down with cattle prods, the hole in my cheek open.Further, I must not dreamfor when I do I see the table setand a faltering crone at my place, her eyes burnt by cigarettesas she eats betrayal like a slice of meat.I must not sleepfor while I'm asleep I'm ninetyand think I'm dying.Death rattles in my throatlike a marble.I wear tubes like earrings.I lie as still as a bar of iron.You can stick a needlethrough my kneecap and I won't flinch.I'm all shot up with Novocain.This trance girlis yours to do with.You could lay her in a grave, an awful package, and shovel dirt on her faceand she'd never call back: Hello there! But if you kissed her on the mouthher eyes would spring openand she'd call out: Daddy! Daddy! Presto! She's out of prison.There was a theft.That much I am told.I was abandoned.That much I know.I was forced backward.I was forced forward.I was passed hand to handlike a bowl of fruit.Each night I am nailed into placeand forget who I am.Daddy? That's another kind of prison.It's not the prince at all, but my fatherdrunkeningly bends over my bed, circling the abyss like a shark, my father thick upon melike some sleeping jellyfish.What voyage is this, little girl? This coming out of prison? God help -this life after death?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy desireis always the same; wherever Lifedeposits me:I want to stick my toe& soon my whole bodyinto the water.I want to shake out a fat broom& sweep dried leavesbruised blossomsdead insects& dust.I want to growsomething.It seems impossible that desirecan sometimes transform into devotion; but this has happened.And that is how I've survived:how the holeI carefully tendedin the garden of my heartgrew a heartto fill it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs I came to the edge of the woods, Thrush music -- hark! Now if it was dusk outside, Inside it was dark. Too dark in the woods for a bird By sleight of wing To better its perch for the night, Though it still could sing. The last of the light of the sun That had died in the west Still lived for one song more In a thrush's breast. Far in the pillared dark Thrush music went -- Almost like a call to come in To the dark and lament. But no, I was out for stars; I would not come in.

O hymenee!   Why do you tantalize me thus?   O why sting me for a swift moment only?   Why can you not continue? O why do you now cease?   Is it because, if you continued beyond the swift moment, you would         soon certainly kill me?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWar broke: and now the Winter of the worldWith perishing great darkness closes in.The foul tornado, centred at Berlin,Is over all the width of Europe whirled,Rending the sails of progress. Rent or furledAre all Art's ensigns. Verse wails. Now beginFamines of thought and feeling. Love's wine's thin.The grain of human Autumn rots, down-hurled.For after Spring had bloomed in early Greece,And Summer blazed her glory out with Rome,An Autumn softly fell, a harvest home,A slow grand age, and rich with all increase.But now, for us, wild Winter, and the needOf sowings for new Spring, and blood for seed.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll of the Indians must have tragic features: tragic noses, eyes, and arms.Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food.The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferablyfrom a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory.If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slenderand in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian manthen he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture.If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so whitethat we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers.When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gaspsat the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature: brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water.If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret.Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed.Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm.Indian men, of course, are storms. The should destroy the livesof any white women who choose to love them. All white women loveIndian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgustat the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him. White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures.Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian manunbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil.There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape.Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds.Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visionsif they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indianthen the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carryan Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breedand obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man.If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is insidea white woman. Sometimes there are complications.An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian womancan be hidden inside a white man.  In these rare instances, everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture.There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven.For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gendernot important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written, all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeen scared and battered.My hopes the wind done scattered.Snow has friz me,Sun has baked me,Looks like between 'em they doneTried to make meStop laughin', stop lovin', stop livin'--But I don't care!I'm still here!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWHERE the bee sucks, there suck I:\t  In a cowslip's bell I lie; \tThere I couch when owls do cry.\tOn the bat's back I do fly.\tAfter summer merrily:  Merrily, merrily, shall I live now  Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJust when hope withers, the visa is granted. The door opens to a street like in the movies, clean of people, of cats; except it is your street you are leaving. A visa has been granted, 'provisionally'-a fretful word. The windows you have closed behind you are turning pink, doing what they do every dawn. Here it's gray. The door to the taxicab waits. This suitcase, the saddest object in the world. Well, the world's open.

I would haveloved you more if I had sat in a small room rolling acigarette and listened to you piss in the bathroom,but that didn’ happen. your letters got sadder.your lovers betrayed you. kid, I wrote back, alllovers betray. it didn’ help. you saidyou had a crying bench and it was by a bridge andthe bridge was over a river and you sat on the cryingbench every night and wept for the lovers who hadhurt and forgotten you. I wrote back but neverheard again. a friend wrote me of your suicide3 or 4 months after it happened. if I had met youI would probably have been unfair to you or youto me. it was best like this.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI waz whitemailedBy a white witch,Wid white magicAn white lies,Branded by a white sheepI slaved as a whitesmithNear a white spotWhere I suffered whitewater fever.Whitelisted as a whitelegI waz in de white bookAs a master of white art,It waz like white death.

Your feet of arched bone, your hard little feet. I know that they support you, and that your sweet weight rises upon them. Your waist and your breasts, the doubled purple of your nipples, the sockets of your eyes that have just flown away, your wide fruit mouth, your red tresses, my little tower. But I love your feet only because they walked upon the earth and upon the wind and upon the waters, until they found me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd suppose the darlings get to Mantua, suppose they cheat the crypt, what next?

Another Montague is in the womb although the first babe's bottom's not yet dry. She scrolls a weekly letter to her Nurse who dares to send a smock through Balthasar, and once a month, his father posts a purse. News from Verona? Always news of war.

The fifth act runs unconscionably long.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI would not exchange the sorrows of my heart For the joys of the multitude.And I would not have the tears that sadness makes To flow from my every part turn into laughter. I would that my life remain a tear and a smile.A tear to purify my heart and give me understandingOf life's secrets and hidden things. A smile to draw me nigh to the sons of my kind and To be a symbol of my glorification of the gods.A tear to unite me with those of broken heart; A smile to be a sign of my joy in existence.I would rather that I died in yearning and longing than that I live Weary and despairing.I want the hunger for love and beauty to be in the Depths of my spirit,for I have seen those who are Satisfied the most wretched of people. I have heard the sigh of those in yearning and Longing, and it is sweeter than the sweetest melody.With evening's coming the flower folds her petals And sleeps, embracingher longing. At morning's approach she opens her lips to meet The sun's kiss.The life of a flower is longing and fulfilment.A tear and a smile.The waters of the sea become vapor and rise and come Together and area cloud.And the cloud floats above the hills and valleys Until it meets the gentle breeze, then falls weeping To the fields and joins with brooks and rivers to Return to the sea, its home.The life of clouds is a parting and a meeting. A tear and a smile.And so does the spirit become separated from The greater spirit to move in the world of matter And pass as a cloud over the mountain of sorrow And the plains of joy to meet the breeze of death And return whence it came.To the ocean of Love and Beauty----to God.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTho' searching damps and many an envious flawHave marred this Work, the calm ethereal grace,The love deep-seated in the Saviour's face,The mercy, goodness, have not failed to aweThe Elements; as they do melt and thawThe heart of the Beholder- and erase(At least for one rapt moment) every traceOf disobedience to the primal law.The annunciation of the dreadful truthMade to the Twelve, survives: lips, forehead, cheek,And hand reposing on the board in ruthOf what it utters, while the unguilty seekUnquestionable meanings, still bespeakA labour worthy of eternal youth!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCome with me and you'll beIn a world of pure imaginationTake a look and you'll seeInto your imaginationWe'll begin with a spinTrav'ling in the world of my creationWhat we'll see will defyExplanation{Refrain}If you want to view paradiseSimply look around and view itAnything you want to, do itWant to change the world, there's nothing to itThere is no life I knowTo compare with pure imaginationLiving there, you'll be freeIf you truly wish to be{Refrain}There is no life I knowTo compare with pure imaginationLiving there, you'll be freeIf you truly wish to be\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll out of doors looked darkly in at himThrough the thin frost, almost in separate stars,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.What kept his eyes from giving back the gazeWas the lamp tilted near them in his hand.What kept him from remembering what it wasThat brought him to that creaking room was age.He stood with barrels round him -- at a loss.And having scared the cellar under himIn clomping there, he scared it once againIn clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roarOf trees and crack of branches, common things,But nothing so like beating on a box.A light he was to no one but himselfWhere now he sat, concerned with he knew what,A quiet light, and then not even that.He consigned to the moon, such as she was,So late-arising, to the broken moonAs better than the sun in any caseFor such a charge, his snow upon the roof,His icicles along the wall to keep;And slept. The log that shifted with a joltOnce in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.One aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,A farm, a countryside, or if he can,It's thus he does it of a winter night.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat tree may not the fig be gathered from? The grape may not be gathered from the birch?It's all you know the grape, or know the birch.As a girl gathered from the birch myselfEqually with my weight in grapes, one autumn,I ought to know what tree the grape is fruit of.I was born, I suppose, like anyone,And grew to be a little boyish girlMy brother could not always leave at home.But that beginning was wiped out in fearThe day I swung suspended with the grapes,And was come after like EurydiceAnd brought down safely from the upper regions;And the life I live now's an extra lifeI can waste as I please on whom I please.So if you see me celebrate two birthdays,And give myself out of two different ages,One of them five years younger than I look-One day my brother led me to a gladeWhere a white birch he knew of stood alone,Wearing a thin head-dress of pointed leaves,And heavy on her heavy hair behind,Against her neck, an ornament of grapes.Grapes, I knew grapes from having seen them last year.One bunch of them, and there began to beBunches all round me growing in white birches,The way they grew round Leif the Lucky's German;Mostly as much beyond my lifted hands, though,As the moon used to seem when I was younger,And only freely to be had for climbing.My brother did the climbing; and at firstThrew me down grapes to miss and scatterAnd have to hunt for in sweet fern and hardhack;Which gave him some time to himself to eat,But not so much, perhaps, as a boy needed.So then, to make me wholly self-supporting,He climbed still higher and bent the tree to earthAnd put it in my hands to pick my own grapes.'Here, take a tree-top, I'll get down another.Hold on with all your might when I let go.'I said I had the tree. It wasn't true.The opposite was true. The tree had me.The minute it was left with me aloneIt caught me up as if I were the fishAnd it the fishpole. So I was translatedTo loud cries from my brother of 'Let go!Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!'But I, with something of the baby gripAcquired ancestrally in just such treesWhen wilder mothers than our wildest nowHung babies out on branches by the handsTo dry or wash or tan, I don't know which,(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)-I held on uncomplainingly for life.My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.'What are you doing up there in those grapes?Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them.'Much danger of my picking anything!By that time I was pretty well reducedTo a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.'Now you know how it feels,' my brother said,'To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,That when it thinks it has escaped the foxBy growing where it shouldn't-on a birch,Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it-And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it-Just then come you and I to gather it.Only you have the advantage of the grapesIn one way: you have one more stem to cling by,And promise more resistance to the picker.'One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,And still I clung. I let my head fall back,And shut my eyes against the sun, my earsAgainst my brother's nonsense; 'Drop,' he said,'I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far.'(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down.'Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.'Why, if she isn't serious about it!Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it.'I don't know much about the letting down;But once I felt ground with my stocking feetAnd the world came revolving back to me,I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.My brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything?Try to weigh something next time, so you won'tBe run off with by birch trees into space.'It wasn't my not weighing anythingSo much as my not knowing anything-My brother had been nearer right before.I had not taken the first step in knowledge;I had not learned to let go with the hands,As still I have not learned to with the heart,And have no wish to with the heart-nor need,That I can see. The mind-is not the heart.I may yet live, as I know others live,To wish in vain to let go with the mind-Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells meThat I need learn to let go with the heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI found a dimpled spider, fat and white,On a white heal-all, holding up a mothLike a white piece of rigid satin cloth --Assorted characters of death and blightMixed ready to begin the morning right,Like the ingredients of a witches' broth --A snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,And dead wings carried like a paper kite.What had that flower to do with being white,The wayside blue and innocent heal-all?What brought the kindred spider to that height,Then steered the white moth thither in the night?What but design of darkness to appall?--If design govern in a thing so small.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tO tower of light, sad beautythat magnified necklaces and statues in the sea,calcareous eye, insignia of the vast waters, cryof the mourning petrel, tooth of the sea, wifeof the Oceanian wind, O separate rosefrom the long stem of the trampled bushthat the depths, converted into archipelago,O natural star, green diadem,alone in your lonesome dynasty,still unattainable, elusive, desolatelike one drop, like one grape, like the sea.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the sky there is nobody asleep. Nobody, nobody.Nobody is asleep.The creatures of the moon sniff and prowl about their cabins.The living iguanas will come and bite the men who do not dream,and the man who rushes out with his spirit broken will meet on the street cornerthe unbelievable alligator quiet beneath the tender protest of thestars.Nobody is asleep on earth. Nobody, nobody.Nobody is asleep.In a graveyard far off there is a corpsewho has moaned for three yearsbecause of a dry countryside on his knee;and that boy they buried this morning cried so muchit was necessary to call out the dogs to keep him quiet.Life is not a dream. Careful! Careful! Careful!We fall down the stairs in order to eat the moist earthor we climb to the knife edge of the snow with the voices of the deaddahlias.But forgetfulness does not exist, dreams do not exist;flesh exists. Kisses tie our mouthsin a thicket of new veins,and whoever his pain pains will feel that pain foreverand whoever is afraid of death will carry it on his shoulders.One day the horses will live in the saloonsand the enraged antswill throw themselves on the yellow skies that take refuge in theeyes of cows.Another daywe will watch the preserved butterflies rise from the deadand still walking through a country of gray sponges and silent boatswe will watch our ring flash and roses spring from our tongue.Careful! Be careful! Be careful!The men who still have marks of the claw and the thunderstorm,and that boy who cries because he has never heard of the invention of the bridge,or that dead man who possesses now only his head and a shoe,we must carry them to the wall where the iguanas and the snakesare waiting,where the bear's teeth are waiting,where the mummified hand of the boy is waiting,and the hair of the camel stands on end with a violent blue shudder.Nobody is sleeping in the sky. Nobody, nobody.Nobody is sleeping.If someone does close his eyes,a whip, boys, a whip!Let there be a landscape of open eyesand bitter wounds on fire.No one is sleeping in this world. No one, no one.I have said it before.No one is sleeping.But if someone grows too much moss on his temples during thenight,open the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlightthe lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am the pillars of the house;The keystone of the arch am I.Take me away, and roof and wallWould fall to ruin me utterly.I am the fire upon the hearth,I am the light of the good sun,I am the heat that warms the earth,Which else were colder than a stone.At me the children warm their hands;I am their light of love alive.Without me cold the hearthstone stands,Nor could the precious children thrive.I am the twist that holds togetherThe children in its sacred ring,Their knot of love, from whose close tetherNo lost child goes a-wandering.I am the house from floor to roof,I deck the walls, the board I spread;I spin the curtains, warp and woof,And shake the down to be their bed.I am their wall against all danger,Their door against the wind and snow,Thou Whom a woman laid in a manger,Take me not till the children grow!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness Were in each of them. Even the crows were so Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in Attics and the urine of lizards and mice....

You and she just sawEach other in passing in the room upstairs,One coming this way into life, and oneGoing the other out of life—you know?So you can't have much recollection of her.She had been having a long look at you.She put her finger in your cheek so hardIt must have made your dimple there, and said,'Maple.' I said it too: 'Yes, for her name.'She nodded. So we're sure there's no mistake.I don't know what she wanted it to mean,But it seems like some word she left to bid youBe a good girl—be like a maple tree.How like a maple tree's for us to guess.Or for a little girl to guess sometime.Not now—at least I shouldn't try too hard now.By and by I will tell you all I knowAbout the different trees, and something, too,About your mother that perhaps may help.'Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.Luckily all she wanted of her name thenWas to rebuke her teacher with it next day,And give the teacher a scare as from her father.Anything further had been wasted on her,Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.She would forget it. She all but forgot it.What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,And came so near death in the dark of years,That when it woke and came to life againThe flower was different from the parent seed.It carne back vaguely at the glass one day,As she stood saying her name over aloud,Striking it gently across her lowered eyesTo make it go well with the way she looked.What was it about her name? Its strangeness layIn having too much meaning. Other names,As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,But hadn't as it went. (She knew a Rose.)This difference from other names it wasMade people notice it—and notice her.(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)Her problem was to find out what it askedIn dress or manner of the girl who bore it.If she could form some notion of her mother—What she bad thought was lovely, and what good.This was her mother's childhood home;The house one story high in front, three storiesOn the end it presented to the road.(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)Her mother's bedroom was her father's still,Where she could watch her mother's picture fading.Once she found for a bookmark in the BibleA maple leaf she thought must have been laidIn wait for her there. She read every wordOf the two pages it was pressed between,As if it was her mother speaking to her.But forgot to put the leaf back in closingAnd lost the place never to read again.She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it.So she looked for herself, as everyoneLooks for himself, more or less outwardly.And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,May still have been what led her on to read,And think a little, and get some city schooling.She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand mayHave had to do with it- she sometimes wondered.So, till she found herself in a strange placeFor the name Maple to have brought her to,Taking dictation on a paper padAnd, in the pauses when she raised her eyes,Watching out of a nineteenth story windowAn airship laboring with unshiplike motionAnd a vague all-disturbing roar above the riverBeyond the highest city built with hands.Someone was saying in such natural tonesShe almost wrote the words down on her knee,'Do you know you remind me of a tree- A maple tree?''Because my name is Maple?''Isn't it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.''No doubt you've heard the office call me Mabel.I have to let them call me what they like.'They were both stirred that he should have divinedWithout the name her personal mystery.It made it seem as if there must be somethingShe must have missed herself. So they were married,And took the fancy home with them to live by.They went on pilgrimage once to her father's(The house one story high in front, three storiesOn the side it presented to the road)To see if there was not some special treeShe might have overlooked. They could find none,Not so much as a single tree for shade,Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.She told him of the bookmark maple leafIn the big Bible, and all she rememberedof the place marked with it—'Wave offering,Something about wave offering, it said.''You've never asked your father outright, have you?''I have, and been Put off sometime, I think.'(This was her faded memory of the wayOnce long ago her father had put himself off.)'Because no telling but it may have beenSomething between your father and your motherNot meant for us at all.''Not meant for me?Where would the fairness be in giving meA name to carry for life and never knowThe secret of?''And then it may have beenSomething a father couldn't tell a daughterAs well as could a mother. And againIt may have been their one lapse into fancy'Twould be too bad to make him sorry forBy bringing it up to him when be was too old.Your father feels us round him with our questing,And holds us off unnecessarily,As if he didn't know what little thingMight lead us on to a discovery.It was as personal as be could beAbout the way he saw it was with youTo say your mother, bad she lived, would beAs far again as from being born to bearing.''Just one look more with what you say in mind,And I give up'; which last look came to nothing.But though they now gave up the search forever,They clung to what one had seen in the otherBy inspiration. It proved there was something.They kept their thoughts away from when the maplesStood uniform in buckets, and the steamOf sap and snow rolled off the sugarhouse.When they made her related to the maples,It was the tree the autumn fire ran throughAnd swept of leathern leaves, but left the barkUnscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke.They always took their holidays in autumn.Once they came on a maple in a glade,Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,And every leaf of foliage she'd wornLaid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.But its age kept them from considering this one.Twenty-five years ago at Maple's namingIt hardly could have been a two-leaved seedlingThe next cow might have licked up out at pasture.Could it have been another maple like it?They hovered for a moment near discovery,Figurative enough to see the symbol,But lacking faith in anything to meanThe same at different times to different people.Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept themFrom thinking it could be a thing so bridal.And anyway it came too late for Maple.She used her hands to cover up her eyes.'We would not see the secret if we could now:We are not looking for it any more.'Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,Made a girl's marriage, and ruled in her life.No matter that the meaning was not clear.A name with meaning could bring up a child,Taking the child out of the parents' hands.Better a meaningless name, I should say,As leaving more to nature and happy chance.Name children some names and see what you do.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI make a pact with you, Walt Whitman - I have detested you long enough.I come to you as a grown childWho has had a pig-headed father;I am old enough now to make friends.It was you that broke the new wood,Now is a time for carving.We have one sap and one root - Let there be commerce between us.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGive me your patience, sister, while I frameExact in capitals your golden name;Or sue the fair Apollo and he willRouse from his heavy slumber and instillGreat love in me for thee and Poesy.Imagine not that greatest masteryAnd kingdom over all the Realms of verse,Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurseAnd surety give to love and Brotherhood.Anthropophagi in Othello's mood;Ulysses storm'd and his enchanted belt Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt Unbosom'd so and so eternal made, Such tender incense in their laurel shadeTo all the regent sisters of the NineAs this poor offering to you, sister mine.Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;And may it taste to you like good old wine,Take you to real happiness and giveSons, daughters and a home like honied hive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling Jingling...

[From Summer in Calcutta]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow great my grief, my joys how few, Since first it was my fate to know thee! - Have the slow years not brought to view How great my grief, my joys how few, Nor memory shaped old times anew,    Nor loving-kindness helped to show thee How great my grief, my joys how few,    Since first it was my fate to know thee?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXXIXI think of thee!—my thoughts do twine and budAbout thee, as wild vines, about a tree,Put out broad leaves, and soon there 's nought to seeExcept the straggling green which hides the wood.Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understoodI will not have my thoughts instead of theeWho art dearer, better! Rather, instantlyRenew thy presence; as a strong tree should,Rustle thy boughs and set thy trunk all bare,And let these bands of greenery which insphere theeDrop heavily down,—burst, shattered, everywhere!Because, in this deep joy to see and hear theeAnd breathe within thy shadow a new air,I do not think of thee—I am too near thee.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI WILL arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee,And live alone in the bee-loud glade.And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,And evening full of the linnet's wings.I will arise and go now, for always night and dayI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,I hear it in the deep heart's core.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate.Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date.Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,And often is his gold complexion dimmed;And every fair from fair sometime declines,By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimmed;But thy eternal summer shall not fade,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st. So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRazors pain you;Rivers are damp;Acids stain you;And drugs cause cramp.Guns aren't lawful;Nooses give;Gas smells awful;You might as well live.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLife has loveliness to sell,All beautiful and splendid things,Blue waves whitened on a cliff,Soaring fire that sways and sings,And children's faces looking up,Holding wonder like a cup.Life has loveliness to sell,Music like the curve of gold,Scent of pine trees in the rain,Eyes that love you, arms that hold,And for your spirit's still delight,Holy thoughts that star the night.Spend all you have for loveliness,Buy it and never count the cost;For one white singing hour of peaceCount many a year of strife well lost,And for a breath of ecstasyGive all you have been, or could be.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNo doubt they’ll soon get well; the shock and strain Have caused their stammering, disconnected talk. Of course they’re ‘longing to go out again,’— These boys with old, scared faces, learning to walk. They’ll soon forget their haunted nights; their cowed Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died,— Their dreams that drip with murder; and they’ll be proud Of glorious war that shatter’d all their pride... Men who went out to battle, grim and glad; Children, with eyes that hate you, broken and mad. Craiglockart. October, 1917.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the milky way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed- and gazed- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>Translated into English in 1859 by Edward FitzGerald</i>I.Awake! for Morning in the Bowl of NightHas flung the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight:And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caughtThe Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light. II.Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the SkyI heard a voice within the Tavern cry,'Awake, my Little ones, and fill the CupBefore Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.' III.And, as the Cock crew, those who stood beforeThe Tavern shouted -  'Open then the Door! You know how little while we have to stay,And, once departed, may return no more.' IV.Now the New Year reviving old Desires,The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,Where the White Hand of Moses on the BoughPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires. V.Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one Knows; But still the Vine her ancient ruby yields,And still a Garden by the Water blows. VI.And David's Lips are lock't; but in divineHigh piping Pehlevi, with 'Wine! Wine! Wine! Red Wine! ' -  the Nightingale cries to the RoseThat yellow Cheek of hers to incarnadine. VII.Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of SpringThe Winter Garment of Repentance fling:The Bird of Time has but a little wayTo fly -  and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing. VIII.Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,The Leaves of Life kep falling one by one. IX.Morning a thousand Roses brings, you say; Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday? And this first Summer month that brings the RoseShall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away. X.But come with old Khayyam, and leave the LotOf Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot:Let Rustum lay about him as he will,Or Hatim Tai cry Supper -  heed them not. XI.With me along the strip of Herbage strownThat just divides the desert from the sown,Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot - And Peace is Mahmud on his Golden Throne! XII.A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread, -  and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness - Oh, Wilderness were Paradise now! XIII.Some for the Glories of This World; and someSigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come; Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go,Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum! XIV.Were it not Folly, Spider-like to spinThe Thread of present Life away to win - What? for ourselves, who know not if we shallBreathe out the very Breath we now breathe in! XV.Look to the Rose that blows about us -  'Lo,Laughing,' she says, 'into the World I blow:At once the silken Tassel of my PurseTear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw.' XVI.The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts uponTurns Ashes -  or it prospers; and anon,Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty FaceLighting a little Hour or two -  is gone. XVII.And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'dAs, buried once, Men want dug up again. XVIII.Think, in this batter'd CaravanseraiWhose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,How Sultan after Sultan with his PompAbode his Hour or two and went his way. XIX.They say the Lion and the Lizard keepThe Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:And Bahram, that great Hunter -  the Wild AssStamps o'er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep. XX.I sometimes think that never blows so redThe Rose as where some buried Caesar bled; That every Hyacinth the Garden wearsDropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head. XXI.And this delightful Herb whose tender GreenFledges the River's Lip on which we lean - Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knowsFrom what once lovely Lip it springs unseen! XXII.Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsTo-day of past Regrets and future Fears - To-morrow? -  Why, To-morrow I may beMyself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years. XXIII.Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and bestThat Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,And one by one crept silently to Rest. XXIV.And we, that now make merry in the RoomThey left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of EarthDescend, ourselves to make a Couch -  for whom? XXV.Ah, make the most of what we may yet spend,Before we too into the Dust descend; Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie; Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and -  sans End! XXVI.Alike for those who for To-day prepare,And those that after some To-morrow stare,A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries'Fools! Your Reward is neither Here nor There! ' XXVII.Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'dOf the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrustLike foolish Prophets forth; their Works to ScornAre scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust. XXVIII.Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the WiseTo talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies; One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies; The Flower that once has blown forever dies. XXIX.Myself when young did eagerly frequentDoctor and Saint, and heard great ArgumentAbout it and about; but evermoreCame out by the same Door as in I went. XXX.With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd - 'I came like Water and like Wind I go.' XXXI.Into this Universe, and Why not knowing,Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing. XXXII.Up from Earth's Centre through the Seventh GateI rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,And many Knots unravel'd by the Road; But not the Master-Knot of Human Fate. XXXIII.There was the Door to which I found no Key:There was the Veil through which I could not see:Some little talk awhile of Me and TheeThere was -  and then no more of Thee and Me. XXXIV.Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,Asking, 'What Lamp had Destiny to guideHer little Children stumbling in the Dark? 'And -  'A blind Understanding! ' Heav'n replied. XXXV.Then to the Lip of this poor earthen UrnI lean'd, the secret Well of Life to learn:And Lip to Lip it murmur'd -  'While you live,Drink! -  for, once dead, you never shall return.' XXXVI.I think the Vessel, that with fugitiveArticulation answer'd, once did live,And merry-make, and the cold Lip I kiss'd,How many Kisses might it take -  and give! XXXVII.For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:And with its all obliterated TongueIt murmur'd -  'Gently, Brother, gently, pray! ' XXXVIII.And has not such a Story from of OldDown Man's successive generations roll'dOf such a clod of saturated EarthCast by the Maker into Human mould? XXXIX.Ah, fill the Cup: -  what boots it to repeatHow Time is slipping underneath our Feet:Unborn To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,Why fret about them if To-day be sweet! XL.A Moment's Halt -  a momentary tasteOf Being from the Well amid the Waste - And Lo! the phantom Caravan has reach'dThe Nothing it set out from -  Oh, make haste! XLI.Oh, plagued no more with Human or Divine,To-morrow's tangle to itself resign,And lose your fingers in the tresses ofThe Cypress-slender Minister of Wine. XLII.Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuitOf This and That endeavor and dispute; Better be merry with the fruitful GrapeThan sadden after none, or bitter, fruit. XLIII.You know, my Friends, with what a brave CarouseI made a Second Marriage in my house; Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse. XLIV.And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel ShapeBearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; andHe bid me taste of it; and 'twas -  the Grape! XLV.The Grape that can with Logic absoluteThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:The subtle Alchemest that in a TriceLife's leaden Metal into Gold transmute. XLVI.Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dareBlaspheme the twisted tendril as Snare? A Blessing, we should use it, should we not? And if a Curse -  why, then, Who set it there? XLVII.But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with meThe Quarrel of the Universe let be:And, in some corner of the Hubbub couch'd,Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee. XLVIII.For in and out, above, about, below,'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,Round which we Phantom Figures come and go. XLIX.Strange, is it not? that of the myriads whoBefore us pass'd the door of Darkness throughNot one returns to tell us of the Road,Which to discover we must travel too. L.The Revelations of Devout and Learn'dWho rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd,Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep,They told their fellows, and to Sleep return'd. LI.Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,Is't not a shame -  Is't not a shame for himSo long in this Clay suburb to abide? LII.But that is but a Tent wherein may restA Sultan to the realm of Death addrest; The Sultan rises, and the dark FerrashStrikes, and prepares it for another guest. LIII.I sent my Soul through the Invisible,Some letter of that After-life to spell:And after many days my Soul return'dAnd said, 'Behold, Myself am Heav'n and Hell.' LIV.Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire,And Hell the Shadow of a Soul on fire,Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,So late emerg'd from, shall so soon expire. LV.While the Rose blows along the River Brink,With old Khayyam and ruby vintage drink:And when the Angel with his darker DraughtDraws up to Thee -  take that, and do not shrink. LVI.And fear not lest Existence closing yourAccount, should lose, or know the type no more; The Eternal Saki from the Bowl has pour'dMillions of Bubbls like us, and will pour. LVII.When You and I behind the Veil are past,Oh but the long long while the World shall last,Which of our Coming and Departure heedsAs much as Ocean of a pebble-cast. LVIII.'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and DaysWhere Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,And one by one back in the Closet lays. LIX.The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,But Right or Left, as strikes the Player goes; And he that toss'd Thee down into the Field,He knows about it all -  He knows -  HE knows! LX.The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it. LXI.For let Philosopher and Doctor preachOf what they will, and what they will not -  eachIs but one Link in an eternal ChainThat none can slip, nor break, nor over-reach. LXII.And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,Lift not thy hands to it for help -  for ItRolls impotently on as Thou or I. LXIII.With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead,And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:Yea, the first Morning of Creation wroteWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read. LXIV.Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; To-morrow's Silence, Triumph, or Despair:Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where. LXV.I tell You this -  When, starting from the Goal,Over the shoulders of the flaming FoalOf Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung,In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and Soul. LXVI.The Vine has struck a fiber: which aboutIf clings my Being -  let the Dervish flout; Of my Base metal may be filed a Key,That shall unlock the Door he howls without. LXVII.And this I know: whether the one True Light,Kindle to Love, or Wrath -  consume me quite,One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caughtBetter than in the Temple lost outright. LXVIII.What! out of senseless Nothing to provokeA conscious Something to resent the yokeOf unpermitted Pleasure, under painOf Everlasting Penalties, if broke! LXIX.What! from his helpless Creature be repaidPure Gold for what he lent us dross-allay'd - Sue for a Debt we never did contract,And cannot answer -  Oh the sorry trade! LXX.Nay, but for terror of his wrathful Face,I swear I will not call Injustice Grace; Not one Good Fellow of the Tavern butWould kick so poor a Coward from the place. LXXI.Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with ginBeset the Road I was to wander in,Thou will not with Predestin'd Evil roundEnmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin? LXXII.Oh, Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,And who with Eden didst devise the Snake; For all the Sin wherewith the Face of ManIs blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give -  and take! LXXIII.Listen again. One Evening at the CloseOf Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,In that old Potter's Shop I stood aloneWith the clay Population round in Rows. LXXIV.And, strange to tell, among that Earthen LotSome could articulate, while others not:And suddenly one more impatient cried - 'Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot? ' LXXV.Then said another -  'Surely not in vainMy Substance from the common Earth was ta'en,That He who subtly wrought me into ShapeShould stamp me back to common Earth again.' LXXVI.Another said -  'Why, ne'er a peevish Boy,Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy; Shall He that made the vessel in pure LoveAnd Fancy, in an after Rage destroy? ' LXXVII.None answer'd this; but after Silence spakeA Vessel of a more ungainly Make:'They sneer at me for leaning all awry; What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake? ' LXXVIII:'Why,' said another, 'Some there are who tellOf one who threatens he will toss to HellThe luckless Pots he marred in making -  Pish! He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well.' LXXIX.Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,'My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,Methinks I might recover by-and-by! ' LXXX.So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,The Little Moon look'd in that all were seeking:And then they jogg'd each other, 'Brother! Brother! Now for the Porter's shoulder-knot a-creaking! ' LXXXI.Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,And wash my Body whence the Life has died,And in a Windingsheet of Vine-leaf wrapt,So bury me by some sweet Garden-side. LXXXII.That ev'n my buried Ashes such a SnareOf Perfume shall fling up into the Air,As not a True Believer passing byBut shall be overtaken unaware. LXXXIII.Indeed the Idols I have loved so longHave done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,And sold my Reputation for a Song. LXXXIV.Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft beforeI swore -  but was I sober when I swore? And then, and then came Spring, and Rose-in-handMy thread-bare Penitence apieces tore. LXXXV.And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,And robb'd me of my Robe of Honor -  well,I often wonder what the Vintners buyOne half so precious as the Goods they sell. LXXXVI.Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose! That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close! The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows! LXXXVII.Would but the Desert of the Fountain yieldOne glimpse -  If dimly, yet indeed, reveal'dTo which the fainting Traveller might spring,As springs the trampled herbage of the field! LXXXVIII.Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits -  and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire! LXXXIX.Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:How oft hereafter rising shall she lookThrough this same Garden after me -  in vain! XC.And when like her, oh Saki, you shall passAmong the Guests star-scatter'd on the Grass,And in your joyous errand reach the spotWhere I made one -  turn down an empty Glass! TAMAM SHUD\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Worcester, Massachusetts,I went with Aunt Consueloto keep her dentist's appointmentand sat and waited for herin the dentist's waiting room.It was winter. It got darkearly. The waiting roomwas full of grown-up people,arctics and overcoats,lamps and magazines.My aunt was insidewhat seemed like a long timeand while I waited and readthe National Geographic(I could read) and carefullystudied the photographs:the inside of a volcano,black, and full of ashes;then it was spilling overin rivulets of fire.Osa and Martin Johnsondressed in riding breeches,laced boots, and pith helmets.A dead man slung on a pole\"Long Pig,\" the caption said.Babies with pointed headswound round and round with string;black, naked women with neckswound round and round with wirelike the necks of light bulbs.Their breasts were horrifying.I read it right straight through.I was too shy to stop.And then I looked at the cover:the yellow margins, the date.Suddenly, from inside,came an oh! of pain--Aunt Consuelo's voice--not very loud or long.I wasn't at all surprised;even then I knew she wasa foolish, timid woman.I might have been embarrassed,but wasn't. What took mecompletely by surprisewas that it was me:my voice, in my mouth.Without thinking at allI was my foolish aunt,I--we--were falling, falling,our eyes glued to the coverof the National Geographic,February, 1918.I said to myself: three daysand you'll be seven years old.I was saying it to stopthe sensation of falling offthe round, turning world.into cold, blue-black space.But I felt: you are an I,you are an Elizabeth,you are one of them.Why should you be one, too?I scarcely dared to lookto see what it was I was.I gave a sidelong glance--I couldn't look any higher--at shadowy gray knees,trousers and skirts and bootsand different pairs of handslying under the lamps.I knew that nothing strangerhad ever happened, that nothingstranger could ever happen.Why should I be my aunt,or me, or anyone?What similaritiesboots, hands, the family voiceI felt in my throat, or eventhe National Geographicand those awful hanging breastsheld us all togetheror made us all just one?How I didn't know anyword for it how \"unlikely\". . .How had I come to be here,like them, and overheara cry of pain that could havegot loud and worse but hadn't?The waiting room was brightand too hot. It was slidingbeneath a big black wave,another, and another.Then I was back in it.The War was on. Outside,in Worcester, Massachusetts,were night and slush and cold,and it was still the fifthof February, 1918.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI never said I loved you, John:Why will you tease me day by day,And wax a weariness to think uponWith always \"do\" and \"pray\"?You Know I never loved you, John;No fault of mine made me your toast:Why will you haunt me with a face as wanAs shows an hour-old ghost?I dare say Meg or Moll would takePity upon you, if you'd ask:And pray don't remain single for my sakeWho can't perform the task.I have no heart?-Perhaps I have not;But then you're mad to take offenceThat don't give you what I have not got:Use your common sense.Let bygones be bygones:Don't call me false, who owed not to be true:I'd rather answer \"No\" to fifty JohnsThan answer \"Yes\" to you.Let's mar our plesant days no more,Song-birds of passage, days of youth:Catch at today, forget the days before:I'll wink at your untruth.Let us strike hands as hearty friends;No more, no less; and friendship's good:Only don't keep in veiw ulterior ends, And points not understoodIn open treaty. Rise aboveQuibbles and shuffling off and on:Here's friendship for you if you like; but love,-No, thank you, John.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWalking through a field with my little brother SethI pointed to a place where kids had made angels in the snow.For some reason, I told him that a troop of angelshad been shot and dissolved when they hit the ground.He asked who had shot them and I said a farmer.Then we were on the roof of the lake.The ice looked like a photograph of water.Why he asked. Why did he shoot them.I didn't know where I was going with this.They were on his property, I said.When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room.Today I traded hellos with my neighbor.Our voices hung close in the new acoustics.A room with the walls blasted to shreds and falling.We returned to our shoveling, working side by side in silence.But why were they on his property, he asked.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFear no more the heat o' the sun; Nor the furious winter's rages, Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages; Golden lads and girls all must, As chimney sweepers come to dust. Fear no more the frown of the great, Thou art past the tyrant's stroke: Care no more to clothe and eat; To thee the reed is as the oak: The sceptre, learning, physic, must All follow this, and come to dust. Fear no more the lightning-flash, Nor the all-dread thunder-stone; Fear not slander, censure rash; Thou hast finished joy and moan; All lovers young, all lovers must Consign to thee, and come to dust. No exorciser harm thee! Nor no witchcraft charm thee! Ghost unlaid forbear thee! Nothing ill come near thee! Quiet consummation have; And renowned be thy grave!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoses are red Violets are blueI've never found someone as patientAs youRoses are redViolets are blueIf you get lostThen I'll look for you Roses are red Violets are blueYou know I'm always sorryWhen I hurt youRoses are red Violets are blueIf I could Id turn back to when i first kissed youRoses are redViolets are blueIf you don't believe meThen what else can I do Roses are red Violets are blueBaby no one knows me As much as youRoses are red Violets are blueBelieve I'll do anythingTo get next to youRoses are red Violets are blueTell me you still love me And I'll run to you Roses are red Violets are blueYou might not knowBut I love you Roses are redViolets are blueThe stars shine brightBut not as bright as you do Roses are redViolets are blue If I could pick anyoneI would pick youRoses are red Violets are blueThe first day I saw you That's when I knewRoses are red Violets are blueNo one will ever love youAs much as I do Roses are red violets are blue Even if you get me mad I'll still be in love with you Roses are red Violets are blueMy heart skips a beat When I'm laying next to youRoses are red Violets are blue If you love me Then show me that that love is true\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I cannot look at your face I look at your feet. Your feet of arched bone, your hard little feet. I know that they support you, and that your sweet weight rises upon them. Your waist and your breasts, the doubled purple of your nipples, the sockets of your eyes that have just flown away, your wide fruit mouth, your red tresses, my little tower.

He questioned softly why I failed?\"For beauty,\" I replied.\"And I for truth - the two are one;We brethren are,\" he said.

It well may be that in a difficult hour, Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, Or nagged by want past resolution's power, I might be driven to sell your love for peace, Or trade the memory of this night for food.

I asked.really, he said, and this job is just like that, noneof the others want anybody to get out of here. that's just the way it isin the postal service! I believe you, I said.just then the supervisor walked up and said,you fellows were talking.there is no talking allowed on thisjob.I had been there for eleven and one-halfyears.I got up off my stool and climbed right up the supervisorand then I reached up and pulled myself rightout of there.it was so easy it was unbelievable.but none of the others followed me.and after that, whenever I had crab legsI thought about that place.I must have thought about that placemaybe 5 or 6 timesbefore I switched to lobster.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere are worse things thanbeing alonebut it often takes decadesto realize thisand most often when you doit's too lateand there's nothing worsethan too late.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMara Mori brought mea pair of sockswhich she knitted herselfwith her sheepherder's hands,two socks as soft as rabbits.I slipped my feet into themas if they were two casesknitted with threads of twilight and goatskin,Violent socks,my feet were two fish made of wool,two long sharkssea blue, shot throughby one golden thread,two immense blackbirds,two cannons,my feet were honored in this wayby these heavenly socks.They were so handsome for the first timemy feet seemed to me unacceptablelike two decrepit firemen,firemen unworthy of that woven fire,of those glowing socks.Nevertheless, I resisted the sharp temptationto save them somewhere as schoolboyskeep fireflies,as learned men collectsacred texts,I resisted the mad impulse to put themin a golden cage and each day give thembirdseed and pieces of pink melon.Like explorers in the junglewho hand over the very rare green deerto the spit and eat it with remorse,I stretched out my feet and pulled onthe magnificent socks and then my shoes.The moral of my ode is this:beauty is twice beautyand what is good is doubly goodwhen it is a matter of two socksmade of wool in winter.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(Soudan Expeditionary Force)   We've fought with many men acrost the seas,  An' some of 'em was brave an' some was not:The Paythan an' the Zulu an' Burmese;  But the Fuzzy was the finest o' the lot.We never got a ha'porth's change of 'im:  'E squatted in the scrub an' 'ocked our 'orses,'E cut our sentries up at Sua~kim~,  An' 'e played the cat an' banjo with our forces.

We took our chanst among the Khyber 'ills,  The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills,  An' a Zulu ~impi~ dished us up in style:But all we ever got from such as they  Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller;We 'eld our bloomin' own, the papers say,  But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us 'oller.    Then 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' the missis and the kid;    Our orders was to break you, an' of course we went an' did.    We sloshed you with Martinis, an' it wasn't 'ardly fair;    But for all the odds agin' you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square. 'E 'asn't got no papers of 'is own,  'E 'asn't got no medals nor rewards,So we must certify the skill 'e's shown  In usin' of 'is long two-'anded swords:When 'e's 'oppin' in an' out among the bush  With 'is coffin-'eaded shield an' shovel-spear,An 'appy day with Fuzzy on the rush  Will last an 'ealthy Tommy for a year.    So 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' your friends which are no more,    If we 'adn't lost some messmates we would 'elp you to deplore;    But give an' take's the gospel, an' we'll call the bargain fair,    For if you 'ave lost more than us, you crumpled up the square! 'E rushes at the smoke when we let drive,  An', before we know, 'e's 'ackin' at our 'ead;'E's all 'ot sand an' ginger when alive,  An' 'e's generally shammin' when 'e's dead.'E's a daisy, 'e's a ducky, 'e's a lamb!

So 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your 'ome in the Soudan;    You're a pore benighted 'eathen but a first-class fightin' man;    An' 'ere's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, with your 'ayrick 'ead of 'air --    You big black boundin' beggar -- for you broke a British square!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn my sky at twilight you are like a cloudand your form and colour are the way I love them.You are mine, mine, woman with sweet lipsand in your life my infinite dreams live.The lamp of my soul dyes your feet,the sour wine is sweeter on your lips,oh reaper of my evening song,how solitary dreams believe you to be mine!You are mine, mine, I go shouting it to the afternoon'swind, and the wind hauls on my widowed voice.Huntress of the depth of my eyes, your plunderstills your nocturnal regard as though it were water.You are taken in the net of my music, my love,and my nets of music are wide as the sky.My soul is born on the shore of your eyes of mourning.In your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begin.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst, her tippet made of tulle, easily lifted off her shoulders and laidon the back of a wooden chair. And her bonnet, the bow undone with a light forward pull. Then the long white dress, a morecomplicated matter with mother-of-pearlbuttons down the back, so tiny and numerous that it takes foreverbefore my hands can part the fabric, like a swimmer's dividing water, and slip inside. You will want to know that she was standingby an open window in an upstairs bedroom, motionless, a little wide-eyed, looking out at the orchard below, the white dress puddled at her feeton the wide-board, hardwood floor. The complexity of women's undergarmentsin nineteenth-century Americais not to be waved off, and I proceeded like a polar explorerthrough clips, clasps, and moorings, catches, straps, and whalebone stays, sailing toward the iceberg of her nakedness. Later, I wrote in a notebookit was like riding a swan into the night, but, of course, I cannot tell you everything -the way she closed her eyes to the orchard, how her hair tumbled free of its pins, how there were sudden dashes whenever we spoke. What I can tell you isit was terribly quiet in Amherstthat Sabbath afternoon, nothing but a carriage passing the house, a fly buzzing in a windowpane. So I could plainly hear her inhalewhen I undid the very tophook-and-eye fastener of her corset and I could hear her sigh when finally it was unloosed, the way some readers sigh when they realizethat Hope has feathers, that reason is a plank, that life is a loaded gunthat looks right at you with a yellow eye.\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo see a World in a Grain of SandAnd a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in an hour.

Let me count the ways.I love thee to the depth and breadth and heightMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sightFor the ends of Being and ideal Grace.I love thee to the level of everyday'sMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.I love thee with the passion put to useIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.I love thee with a love I seemed to loseWith my lost saints,—I love thee with the breath,Smiles, tears, of all my life!—and, if God choose,I shall but love thee better after death.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Is there anybody there?\" said the Traveller,Knocking on the moonlit door;And his horse in the silence champed the grassOf the forest's ferny floor;And a bird flew up out of the turret,Above the Traveller's head:And he smote upon the door again a second time;\"Is there anybody there?\" he said.But no one descended to the Traveller;No head from the leaf-fringed sillLeaned over and looked into his grey eyes,Where he stood perplexed and still.But only a host of phantom listenersThat dwelt in the lone house thenStood listening in the quiet of the moonlightTo that voice from the world of men:Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,That goes down to the empty hall,Hearkening in an air stirred and shakenBy the lonely Traveller's call.And he felt in his heart their strangeness,Their stillness answering his cry,While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,'Neath the starred and leafy sky;For he suddenly smote on the door, evenLouder, and lifted his head:--\"Tell them I came, and no one answered,That I kept my word,\" he said.Never the least stir made the listeners,Though every word he spakeFell echoing through the shadowiness of the still houseFrom the one man left awake:Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,And the sound of iron on stone,And how the silence surged softly backward,When the plunging hoofs were gone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLast night as I was sleeping,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that a spring was breakingout in my heart.I said: Along which secret aqueduct,Oh water, are you coming to me,water of a new lifethat I have never drunk?Last night as I was sleeping,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that I had a beehivehere inside my heart.And the golden beeswere making white combsand sweet honeyfrom my old failures.Last night as I was sleeping,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that a fiery sun was givinglight inside my heart.It was fiery because I feltwarmth as from a hearth,and sun because it gave lightand brought tears to my eyes.Last night as I slept,I dreamt—marvelous error!—that it was God I hadhere inside my heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-    \"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.    We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.\"    I ask, \"But how am I to get up to you ?\"    They answer, \"Come to the edge of the earth, lift up yourhands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.\"    \"My mother is waiting for me at home, \"I say, \"How can I leaveher and come?\"    Then they smile and float away.    But I know a nicer game than that, mother.    I shall be the cloud and you the moon.    I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top willbe the blue sky.    The folk who live in the waves call out to me-    \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and knownot where we pass.\"    I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"    They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand withyour eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"    I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the everything-how can I leave her and go?\"    They smile, dance and pass by.    But I know a better game than that.    I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.    I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap withlaughter.    And no one in the world will know where we both are.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEscape me?Never---Beloved!While I am I, and you are you,  So long as the world contains us both,  Me the loving and you the lothWhile the one eludes, must the other pursue. My life is a fault at last, I fear:  It seems too much like a fate, indeed!  Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed.But what if I fail of my purpose here?It is but to keep the nerves at strain,  To dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall,And, baffled, get up and begin again,---  So the chace takes up one's life ' that's all. While, look but once from your farthest bound  At me so deep in the dust and dark,No sooner the old hope goes to ground  Than a new one, straight to the self-same mark,I shape me---EverRemoved!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death.I hear him leading his horse out of the stall; I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.But I will not hold the bridlewhile he clinches the girth.And he may mount by himself: I will not give him a leg up. Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,I will not tell him which way the fox ran.With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where the black boy hides in the swamp.I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;I am not on his pay-roll. I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends nor of my enemies either.Though he promise me much, I will not map him the route to any man's door.Am I a spy in the land of the living,that I should deliver men to Death?Brother, the password and the plans of our city are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore than halfway up the passWas a spring with a broken drinking glass,And whether the farmer drank or notHis mare was sure to observe the spotBy cramping the wheel on a water-bar,turning her forehead with a star,And straining her ribs for a monster sigh;To which the farmer would make reply,'A sigh for every so many breath,And for every so many sigh a death.That's what I always tell my wifeIs the multiplication table of life.'The saying may be ever so true;But it's just the kind of a thing that youNor I, nor nobody else may say,Unless our purpose is doing harm,And then I know of no better wayTo close a road, abandon a farm,Reduce the births of the human race,And bring back nature in people's place.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Rock, A River, A TreeHosts to species long since departed,Mark the mastodon.The dinosaur, who left dry tokensOf their sojourn hereOn our planet floor,Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doomIs lost in the gloom of dust and ages.But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,Come, you may stand upon myBack and face your distant destiny,But seek no haven in my shadow.I will give you no hiding place down here.You, created only a little lower thanThe angels, have crouched too long inThe bruising darkness,Have lain too longFace down in ignorance.Your mouths spelling wordsArmed for slaughter.The rock cries out today, you may stand on me,But do not hide your face.Across the wall of the world,A river sings a beautiful song,Come rest here by my side.Each of you a bordered country,Delicate and strangely made proud,Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.Your armed struggles for profitHave left collars of waste uponMy shore, currents of debris upon my breast.Yet, today I call you to my riverside,If you will study war no more.Come, clad in peace and I will sing the songsThe Creator gave to me when IAnd the tree and stone were one.Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your browAnd when you yet knew you still knew nothing.The river sings and sings on.There is a true yearning to respond toThe singing river and the wise rock.So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew,The African and Native American, the Sioux,The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek,The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheikh,The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,The privileged, the homeless, the teacher.They hear.

Sculpt it intoThe image of your most public self.Lift up your hearts.Each new hour holds new chancesFor new beginnings.Do not be wedded foreverTo fear, yoked eternallyTo brutishness.The horizon leans forward,Offering you space to place new steps of change.Here, on the pulse of this fine dayYou may have the courageTo look up and out upon me,The rock, the river, the tree, your country.No less to Midas than the mendicant.No less to you now than the mastodon then.Here on the pulse of this new dayYou may have the grace to look up and outAnd into your sister's eyes,Into your brother's face, your countryAnd say simplyVery simplyWith hopeGood morning.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnow falling and night falling fast, oh, fastIn a field I looked into going past,And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,But a few weeds and stubble showing last. The woods around it have it - it is theirs.All animals are smothered in their lairs.I am too absent-spirited to count;The loneliness includes me unawares. And lonely as it is, that lonelinessWill be more lonely ere it will be less -A blanker whiteness of benighted snowWIth no expression, nothing to express.

Through the park Voices of boys rang saddening like a hymn, Voices of play and pleasure after day, Till gathering sleep had mothered them from him. About this time Town used to swing so gay When glow-lamps budded in the light blue trees, And girls glanced lovelier as the air grew dim,- In the old times, before he threw away his knees. Now he will never feel again how slim Girls' waists are, or how warm their subtle hands. All of them touch him like some queer disease. There was an artist silly for his face, For it was younger than his youth, last year. Now, he is old; his back will never brace; He's lost his colour very far from here, Poured it down shell-holes till the veins ran dry, And half his lifetime lapsed in the hot race And leap of purple spurted from his thigh. One time he liked a blood-smear down his leg, After the matches, carried shoulder-high. It was after football, when he'd drunk a peg, He thought he'd better join. - He wonders why. Someone had said he'd look a god in kilts, That's why; and maybe, too, to please his Meg, Aye, that was it, to please the giddy jilts He asked to join. He didn't have to beg; Smiling they wrote his lie: aged nineteen years. Germans he scarcely thought of; all their guilt, And Austria's, did not move him. And no fears Of Fear came yet. He thought of jewelled hilts For daggers in plaid socks; of smart salutes; And care of arms; and leave; and pay arrears; Esprit de corps; and hints for young recruits. And soon, he was drafted out with drums and cheers. Some cheered him home, but not as crowds cheer Goal. Only a solemn man who brought him fruits Thanked him; and then enquired about his soul. Now, he will spend a few sick years in institutes, And do what things the rules consider wise, And take whatever pity they may dole. Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes Passed from him to the strong men that were whole. How cold and late it is! Why don't they come And put him into bed? Why don't they come?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWHEN you are old and grey and full of sleep,And nodding by the fire, take down this book,And slowly read, and dream of the soft lookYour eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;How many loved your moments of glad grace,And loved your beauty with love false or true,But one man loved the pilgrim Soul in you,And loved the sorrows of your changing face;And bending down beside the glowing bars,Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fledAnd paced upon the mountains overheadAnd hid his face amid a crowd of stars.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnna who was mad, I have a knife in my armpit.When I stand on tiptoe I tap out messages.Am I some sort of infection?

I said.Anything familiar?Yes, you said. The bed.Better to watch the streamthat flows across the floorand is made of sunlight,the forest made of shadows;better to watch the fireplacewhich is now a beach.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey did this to her, the men who know her, the manShe loved, who loved her not enough, being selfishAnd a coward, the husband who neither loved norUsed her, but was a ruthless watcher, and the bandOf cynics she turned to, clinging to their chests whereNew hair sprouted like great-winged moths, burrowing herFace into their smells and their young lusts to forgetTo forget, oh, to forget, and, they said, each ofThem, I do not love, I cannot love, it is notIn my nature to love, but I can be kind to you.They let her slide from pegs of sanity intoA bed made soft with tears, and she lay there weeping,For sleep had lost its use. I shall build walls with tears,She said, walls to shut me in. Her husband shut herIn, every morning, locked her in a room of booksWith a streak of sunshine lying near the door likeA yellow cat to keep her company, but soonWinter came, and one day while locking her in, heNoticed that the cat of sunshine was only aLine, a half-thin line, and in the evening whenHe returned to take her out, she was a cold andHalf dead woman, now of no use at all to men.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Last love,proper in conclusion,should snip the wingsforbidding further flight.But I, now,reft of that confusion,am lifted upand speeding toward the light.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe apparition of these faces in the crowd; petals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle.Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers init after all, a place for the genuine.Hands that can grasp, eyesthat can dilate, hair that can riseif it must, these things are important not because ahigh-sounding interpretation can be put upon them but becausethey areuseful. When they become so derivative as to become unintelligible, the same thing may be said for all of us, that wedo not admire whatwe cannot understand: the batholding on upside down or in quest of something toeat, elephants pushing, a wild horse taking a roll, a tireless wolfundera tree, the immovable critic twitching his skin like a horse thatfeels aflea, the base-ball fan, the statistician--nor is it validto discriminate against 'business documents andschool-books'; all these phenomena are important. One mustmake a distinctionhowever: when dragged into prominence by half poets, theresult is not poetry,nor till the poets among us can be'literalists of the imagination'--aboveinsolence and triviality and can presentfor inspection, 'imaginary gardens with real toads in them', shallwe haveit. In the meantime, if you demand on the one hand,the raw material of poetry inall its rawness andthat which is on the other handgenuine, you are interested in poetry.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd death shall have no dominion.Dead man naked they shall be oneWith the man in the wind and the west moon; When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,They shall have stars at elbow and foot; Though they go mad they shall be sane,Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; Though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.And death shall have no dominion.Under the windings of the seaThey lying long shall not die windily; Twisting on racks when sinews give way,Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; Faith in their hands shall snap in two,And the unicorn evils run them through; Split all ends up they shan't crack; And death shall have no dominion.And death shall have no dominion.No more may gulls cry at their earsOr waves break loud on the seashores; Where blew a flower may a flower no moreLift its head to the blows of the rain; Though they be mad and dead as nails,Heads of the characters hammer through daisies; Break in the sun till the sun breaks down,And death shall have no dominion.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLove is not all: it is not meat nor drinkNor slumber nor a roof against the rain; Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink And rise and sink and rise and sink again; Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; Yet many a man is making friends with death Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. It well may be that in a difficult hour, Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, Or nagged by want past resolution's power, I might be driven to sell your love for peace, Or trade the memory of this night for food. It well may be. I do not think I would.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:All mimsy were the borogoves,And the mome raths outgrabe.'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!Beware the Jubjub bird, and shunThe frumious Bandersnatch!'He took his vorpal sword in hand:Long time the manxome foe he sought --So rested he by the Tumtum tree,And stood a while in thought.And, as in uffish thought he stood,The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,And burbled as it came!One two!

And living-cleanComes back with thoughts of home and hours of sleep.To-night I smell the battle; miles awayGun-thunder leaps and thuds along the ridge;The spouting shells dig pits in fields of death,And wounded men, are moaning in the woods.If any friend be there whom I have loved,God speed him safe to England with a gash.It's sundown in the camp; some youngster laughs,Lifting his mug and drinking health to allWho come unscathed from that unpitying waste:(Terror and ruin lurk behind his gaze.)Another sits with tranquil, musing face,Puffing bis pipe and dreaming of the girlWhose last scrawled letter lies upon his knee.The sunlight falls, low-ruddy from the west,Upon their heads. Last week they might have diedAnd now they stretch their limbs in tired content.One says 'The bloody Bosche has got the knock;'And soon they'll crumple up and chuck their games.'We've got the beggars on the run at last!'Then I remembered someone that I'd seenDead in a squalid, miserable ditch,Heedless of toiling feet that trod him down.He was a Prussian with a decent face,Young, fresh, and pleasant, so 1 dare to say.No doubt he loathed the war and longed for peace,And cursed our souls because we'd killed bis friends.One night he yawned along a haIf-dug trenchMidnight; and then the British guns beganWith heavy shrapnel bursting low, and 'hows'Whistling to cut the wire with blinding din.He didn't move; the digging still went on;Men stooped and shovelled; someone gave a grunt,And moaned and died with agony in the sludge.Then the long hiss of shells lifted and stopped.He stared into the gloom; a rocket curved,And rifles rattled angrily on the leftDown by the wood, and there was noise of bombs.Then the damned English loomed in scrambling hasteOut of the dark and struggled through the wire,And there were shouts and eurses; someone screamedAnd men began to blunder down the trenchWithout their rifles. It was time to go:He grabbed his coat; stood up, gulping some bread;Then clutched his head and fell.I found him thereIn the gray morning when the place was held.His face was in the mud; one arm flung outAs when he crumpled up; his sturdy legsWere bent beneath bis trunk; heels to the skye.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe weight of the worldis love.Under the burdenof solitude,under the burdenof dissatisfactionthe weight,the weight we carryis love.Who can deny?In dreamsit touchesthe body,in thoughtconstructsa miracle,in imaginationanguishestill bornin human--looks out of the heartburning with purity--for the burden of lifeis love,but we carry the weightwearily,and so must restin the arms of loveat last,must rest in the armsof love.No restwithout love,no sleepwithout dreamsof love--be mad or chillobsessed with angelsor machines,the final wishis love--cannot be bitter,cannot deny,cannot withholdif denied:the weight is too heavy--must givefor no returnas thoughtis givenin solitudein all the excellenceof its excess.The warm bodiesshine togetherin the darkness,the hand movesto the centerof the flesh,the skin tremblesin happinessand the soul comesjoyful to the eye--yes, yes,that's whatI wanted,I always wanted,I always wanted,to returnto the bodywhere I was born.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wonder, by my truth, what thou and IDid, till we loved; were we not weaned till then,But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers' den?'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.If ever any beauty I did see,Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.And now good morrow to our waking souls,Which watch not one another out of fear;For love, all love of other sights controls,And makes one little room, an everywhere.Let sead discoveries to new worlds have gone,Let maps to others, worlds on worlds have shown,Let us possess our world; each hath one and is one.My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;Where can we find two better hemispheres,Without sharp North, without declining West?Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;If our two loves be one;

The moon, like a flower,     In heaven's high bower,     With silent delight     Sits and smiles on the night.Farewell, green fields and happy groves,Where flocks have took delight.Where lambs have nibbled, silent movesThe feet of angels bright;     Unseen they pour blessing,     And joy without ceasing,     On each bud and blossom,     And each sleeping bosom.They look in every thoughtless nest,Where birds are covered warm;They visit caves of every beast,To keep them all from harm.     If they see any weeping     That should have been sleeping,     They pour sleep on their head,     And sit down by their bed.When wolves and tigers howl for prey,They pitying stand and weep;Seeking to drive their thirst away,And keep them from the sheep.     But if they rush dreadful,     The angels, most heedful,     Receive each mild spirit,     New worlds to inherit.And there the lion's ruddy eyesShall flow with tears of gold,And pitying the tender cries,And walking round the fold,     Saying, 'Wrath, by His meekness,     And, by His health, sickness     Is driven away     From our immortal day.'And now beside thee, bleating lamb,I can lie down and sleep;Or think on Him who bore thy name,Graze after thee and weep.     For, washed in life's river,     My bright mane for ever     Shall shine like the gold     As I guard o'er the fold.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Me an' ma baby'sGot two mo' ways,Two mo' ways to do de Charleston!'Da, da,Da, da, da!Two mo' ways to do de Charleston!'Soft light on the tables,Music gay,Brown-skin steppersIn a cabaret.White folks, laugh!White folks, pray!'Me an' ma baby'sGot two mo' ways,Two mo' ways to do deCharleston!'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo be in love Is to touch with a lighter hand.

He is not there but You know you are tasting together The winter, or a light spring weather. His hand to take your hand is overmuch. Too much to bear. You cannot look in his eyes Because your pulse must not say What must not be said. When he Shuts a door- Is not there_ Your arms are water. And you are free With a ghastly freedom. You are the beautiful half Of a golden hurt. You remember and covet his mouth To touch, to whisper on. Oh when to declare Is certain Death! Oh when to apprize Is to mesmerize, To see fall down, the Column of Gold, Into the commonest ash.Anonymous submission.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI have known the inexorable sadness of pencils,Neat in their boxes, dolor of pad and paper weight,All the misery of manilla folders and mucilage,Desolation in immaculate public places,Lonely reception room, lavatory, switchboard,The unalterable pathos of basin and pitcher,Ritual of multigraph, paper-clip, comma,Endless duplicaton of lives and objects.And I have seen dust from the walls of institutions,Finer than flour, alive, more dangerous than silica,Sift, almost invisible, through long afternoons of tedium,Dropping a fine film on nails and delicate eyebrows,Glazing the pale hair, the duplicate grey standard faces.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow do you like to go up in a swing, Up in the air so blue?

Up in the air and over the wall, Till I can see so wide, River and trees and cattle and all Over the countryside-- Till I look down on the garden green, Down on the roof so brown-- Up in the air I go flying again, Up in the air and down!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocracy will not comeToday, this yearNor everThrough compromise and fear.I have as much right As the other fellow hasTo standOn my two feet And own the land.I tire so of hearing people say, Let things take their course.Tomorrow is another day.I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.FreedomIs a strong seedPlantedIn a great need.I live here, too.I want freedomJust as you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWEAVERS, weaving at break of day, Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . . Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild, We weave the robes of a new-born child.Weavers, weaving at fall of night, Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . . Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green, We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.Weavers, weaving solemn and still, What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . . White as a feather and white as a cloud, We weave a dead man's funeral shroud.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLo! where the Moon along the skySails with her happy destiny;Oft is she hid from mortal eyeOr dimly seen,But when the clouds asunder flyHow bright her mien!Far different we--a froward race,Thousands though rich in Fortune's graceWith cherished sullenness of paceTheir way pursue, Ingrates who wear a smileless faceThe whole year through.If kindred humours e'er would makeMy spirit droop for drooping's sake,From Fancy following in thy wake,Bright ship of heaven!A counter impulse let me takeAnd be forgiven.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe people I love the bestjump into work head firstwithout dallying in the shallowsand swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.They seem to become natives of that element,the black sleek heads of sealsbouncing like half-submerged balls.I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,who do what has to be done, again and again.I want to be with people who submergein the task, who go into the fields to harvestand work in a row and pass the bags along,who are not parlor generals and field desertersbut move in a common rhythmwhen the food must come in or the fire be put out.The work of the world is common as mud.Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.But the thing worth doing well donehas a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.Greek amphoras for wine or oil, Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museumsbut you know they were made to be used. The pitcher cries for water to carryand a person for work that is real.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe apparition of these faces in the crowd; petals on a wet, black bough.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may tread me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I'll rise.Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard'Cause I laugh like I've got gold minesDiggin' in my own back yard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise.Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I've got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shameI riseUp from a past that's rooted in painI riseI'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that's wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSouth of my days' circle, part of my blood's country,rises that tableland, high delicate outlineof bony slopes wincing under the winter,low trees, blue-leaved and olive, outcropping granite-clean, lean, hungry country. The creek's leaf-silenced,willow choked, the slope a tangle of medlar and crabapplebranching over and under, blotched with a green lichen;and the old cottage lurches in for shelter.O cold the black-frost night. The walls draw in to the warmthand the old roof cracks its joints; the slung kettlehisses a leak on the fire. Hardly to be believed that summer will turn up again some day in a wave of rambler-roses,thrust it's hot face in here to tell another yarn-a story old Dan can spin into a blanket against the winter.Seventy years of stories he clutches round his bones.Seventy years are hived in him like old honey.Droving that year, Charleville to the Hunter,nineteen-one it was, and the drought beginning;sixty head left at the McIntyre, the mud round themhardened like iron; and the yellow boy diedin the sulky ahead with the gear, but the horse went on,stopped at Sandy Camp and waited in the evening.It was the flies we seen first, swarming like bees.Came to the Hunter, three hundred head of a thousand-cruel to keep them alive - and the river was dust.Or mustering up in the Bogongs in the autumnwhen the blizzards came early. Brought them down; webrought them down, what aren't there yet. Or driving for Cobb's on the runup from Tamworth-Thunderbolt at the top of Hungry Hill,and I give him a wink. I wouldn't wait long, Fred,not if I was you. The troopers are just behind,coming for that job at the Hillgrove. He went like a luny, him on his big black horse. Oh, they slide and they vanishas he shuffles the years like a pack of conjuror's cards.True or not, it's all the same; and the frost on the roofcracks like a whip, and the back-log break into ash.Wake, old man. This is winter, and the yarns are over.No-one is listeningSouth of my days' circleI know it dark against the stars, the high lean countryfull of old stories that still go walking in my sleep.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOne Christmas was so much like another, in those years around the sea-town corner now and out of all sound except the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six.All the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hands in the snow and bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting at the rim of the carol-singing sea, and out come Mrs. Prothero and the firemen.It was on the afternoon of the Christmas Eve, and I was in Mrs. Prothero's garden, waiting for cats, with her son Jim. It was snowing. It was always snowing at Christmas. December, in my memory, is white as Lapland, though there were no reindeers. But there were cats. Patient, cold and callous, our hands wrapped in socks, we waited to snowball the cats. Sleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered, spitting and snarling, they would slink and sidle over the white back-garden walls, and the lynx-eyed hunters, Jim and I, fur-capped and moccasined trappers from Hudson Bay, off Mumbles Road, would hurl our deadly snowballs at the green of their eyes. The wise cats never appeared.We were so still, Eskimo-footed arctic marksmen in the muffling silence of the eternal snows - eternal, ever since Wednesday - that we never heard Mrs. Prothero's first cry from her igloo at the bottom of the garden. Or, if we heard it at all, it was, to us, like the far-off challenge of our enemy and prey, the neighbor's polar cat. But soon the voice grew louder.\"Fire!\" cried Mrs. Prothero, and she beat the dinner-gong.And we ran down the garden, with the snowballs in our arms, toward the house; and smoke, indeed, was pouring out of the dining-room, and the gong was bombilating, and Mrs. Prothero was announcing ruin like a town crier in Pompeii. This was better than all the cats in Wales standing on the wall in a row. We bounded into the house, laden with snowballs, and stopped at the open door of the smoke-filled room.Something was burning all right; perhaps it was Mr. Prothero, who always slept there after midday dinner with a newspaper over his face. But he was standing in the middle of the room, saying, \"A fine Christmas!\" and smacking at the smoke with a slipper.\"Call the fire brigade,\" cried Mrs. Prothero as she beat the gong.\"There won't be there,\" said Mr. Prothero, \"it's Christmas.\"There was no fire to be seen, only clouds of smoke and Mr. Prothero standing in the middle of them, waving his slipper as though he were conducting.\"Do something,\" he said. And we threw all our snowballs into the smoke - I think we missed Mr. Prothero - and ran out of the house to the telephone box.\"Let's call the police as well,\" Jim said. \"And the ambulance.\" \"And Ernie Jenkins, he likes fires.\"But we only called the fire brigade, and soon the fire engine came and three tall men in helmets brought a hose into the house and Mr. Prothero got out just in time before they turned it on. Nobody could have had a noisier Christmas Eve. And when the firemen turned off the hose and were standing in the wet, smoky room, Jim's Aunt, Miss. Prothero, came downstairs and peered in at them. Jim and I waited, very quietly, to hear what she would say to them. She said the right thing, always. She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, \"Would you like anything to read?\"Years and years ago, when I was a boy, when there were wolves in Wales, and birds the color of red-flannel petticoats whisked past the harp-shaped hills, when we sang and wallowed all night and day in caves that smelt like Sunday afternoons in damp front farmhouse parlors, and we chased, with the jawbones of deacons, the English and the bears, before the motor car, before the wheel, before the duchess-faced horse, when we rode the daft and happy hills bareback, it snowed and it snowed. But here a small boy says: \"It snowed last year, too. I made a snowman and my brother knocked it down and I knocked my brother down and then we had tea.\"\"But that was not the same snow,\" I say. \"Our snow was not only shaken from white wash buckets down the sky, it came shawling out of the ground and swam and drifted out of the arms and hands and bodies of the trees; snow grew overnight on the roofs of the houses like a pure and grandfather moss, minutely -ivied the walls and settled on the postman, opening the gate, like a dumb, numb thunder-storm of white, torn Christmas cards.\"\"Were there postmen then, too?\"\"With sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully. But all that the children could hear was a ringing of bells.\"\"You mean that the postman went rat-a-tat-tat and the doors rang?\"\"I mean that the bells the children could hear were inside them.\"\"I only hear thunder sometimes, never bells.\"\"There were church bells, too.\"\"Inside them?\"\"No, no, no, in the bat-black, snow-white belfries, tugged by bishops and storks. And they rang their tidings over the bandaged town, over the frozen foam of the powder and ice-cream hills, over the crackling sea. It seemed that all the churches boomed for joy under my window; and the weathercocks crew for Christmas, on our fence.\"\"Get back to the postmen\"\"They were just ordinary postmen, found of walking and dogs and Christmas and the snow. They knocked on the doors with blue knuckles ....\"\"Ours has got a black knocker....\"\"And then they stood on the white Welcome mat in the little, drifted porches and huffed and puffed, making ghosts with their breath, and jogged from foot to foot like small boys wanting to go out.\"\"And then the presents?\"\"And then the Presents, after the Christmas box. And the cold postman, with a rose on his button-nose, tingled down the tea-tray-slithered run of the chilly glinting hill. He went in his ice-bound boots like a man on fishmonger's slabs. \"He wagged his bag like a frozen camel's hump, dizzily turned the corner on one foot, and, by God, he was gone.\"\"Get back to the Presents.\"\"There were the Useful Presents: engulfing mufflers of the old coach days, and mittens made for giant sloths; zebra scarfs of a substance like silky gum that could be tug-o'-warred down to the galoshes; blinding tam-o'-shanters like patchwork tea cozies and bunny-suited busbies and balaclavas for victims of head-shrinking tribes; from aunts who always wore wool next to the skin there were mustached and rasping vests that made you wonder why the aunts had any skin left at all; and once I had a little crocheted nose bag from an aunt now, alas, no longer whinnying with us. And pictureless books in which small boys, though warned with quotations not to, would skate on Farmer Giles' pond and did and drowned; and books that told me everything about the wasp, except why.\"\"Go on the Useless Presents.\"\"Bags of moist and many-colored jelly babies and a folded flag and a false nose and a tram-conductor's cap and a machine that punched tickets and rang a bell; never a catapult; once, by mistake that no one could explain, a little hatchet; and a celluloid duck that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow; and a painting book in which I could make the grass, the trees, the sea and the animals any colour I pleased, and still the dazzling sky-blue sheep are grazing in the red field under the rainbow-billed and pea-green birds. Hardboileds, toffee, fudge and allsorts, crunches, cracknels, humbugs, glaciers, marzipan, and butterwelsh for the Welsh. And troops of bright tin soldiers who, if they could not fight, could always run. And Snakes-and-Families and Happy Ladders. And Easy Hobbi-Games for Little Engineers, complete with instructions. Oh, easy for Leonardo! And a whistle to make the dogs bark to wake up the old man next door to make him beat on the wall with his stick to shake our picture off the wall. And a packet of cigarettes: you put one in your mouth and you stood at the corner of the street and you waited for hours, in vain, for an old lady to scold you for smoking a cigarette, and then with a smirk you ate it. And then it was breakfast under the balloons.\"\"Were there Uncles like in our house?\"\"There are always Uncles at Christmas. The same Uncles. And on Christmas morning, with dog-disturbing whistle and sugar fags, I would scour the swatched town for the news of the little world, and find always a dead bird by the Post Office or by the white deserted swings; perhaps a robin, all but one of his fires out. Men and women wading or scooping back from chapel, with taproom noses and wind-bussed cheeks, all albinos, huddles their stiff black jarring feathers against the irreligious snow. Mistletoe hung from the gas brackets in all the front parlors; there was sherry and walnuts and bottled beer and crackers by the dessertspoons; and cats in their fur-abouts watched the fires; and the high-heaped fire spat, all ready for the chestnuts and the mulling pokers. Some few large men sat in the front parlors, without their collars, Uncles almost certainly, trying their new cigars, holding them out judiciously at arms' length, returning them to their mouths, coughing, then holding them out again as though waiting for the explosion; and some few small aunts, not wanted in the kitchen, nor anywhere else for that matter, sat on the very edge of their chairs, poised and brittle, afraid to break, like faded cups and saucers.\"Not many those mornings trod the piling streets: an old man always, fawn-bowlered, yellow-gloved and, at this time of year, with spats of snow, would take his constitutional to the white bowling green and back, as he would take it wet or fire on Christmas Day or Doomsday; sometimes two hale young men, with big pipes blazing, no overcoats and wind blown scarfs, would trudge, unspeaking, down to the forlorn sea, to work up an appetite, to blow away the fumes, who knows, to walk into the waves until nothing of them was left but the two furling smoke clouds of their inextinguishable briars. Then I would be slap-dashing home, the gravy smell of the dinners of others, the bird smell, the brandy, the pudding and mince, coiling up to my nostrils, when out of a snow-clogged side lane would come a boy the spit of myself, with a pink-tipped cigarette and the violet past of a black eye, cocky as a bullfinch, leering all to himself.I hated him on sight and sound, and would be about to put my dog whistle to my lips and blow him off the face of Christmas when suddenly he, with a violet wink, put his whistle to his lips and blew so stridently, so high, so exquisitely loud, that gobbling faces, their cheeks bulged with goose, would press against their tinsled windows, the whole length of the white echoing street. For dinner we had turkey and blazing pudding, and after dinner the Uncles sat in front of the fire, loosened all buttons, put their large moist hands over their watch chains, groaned a little and slept. Mothers, aunts and sisters scuttled to and fro, bearing tureens. Auntie Bessie, who had already been frightened, twice, by a clock-work mouse, whimpered at the sideboard and had some elderberry wine. The dog was sick. Auntie Dosie had to have three aspirins, but Auntie Hannah, who liked port, stood in the middle of the snowbound back yard, singing like a big-bosomed thrush. I would blow up balloons to see how big they would blow up to; and, when they burst, which they all did, the Uncles jumped and rumbled. In the rich and heavy afternoon, the Uncles breathing like dolphins and the snow descending, I would sit among festoons and Chinese lanterns and nibble dates and try to make a model man-o'-war, following the Instructions for Little Engineers, and produce what might be mistaken for a sea-going tramcar.Or I would go out, my bright new boots squeaking, into the white world, on to the seaward hill, to call on Jim and Dan and Jack and to pad through the still streets, leaving huge footprints on the hidden pavements.\"I bet people will think there's been hippos.\"\"What would you do if you saw a hippo coming down our street?\"\"I'd go like this, bang! I'd throw him over the railings and roll him down the hill and then I'd tickle him under the ear and he'd wag his tail.\"\"What would you do if you saw two hippos?\"Iron-flanked and bellowing he-hippos clanked and battered through the scudding snow toward us as we passed Mr. Daniel's house.\"Let's post Mr. Daniel a snow-ball through his letter box.\"\"Let's write things in the snow.\"\"Let's write, 'Mr. Daniel looks like a spaniel' all over his lawn.\"Or we walked on the white shore. \"Can the fishes see it's snowing?\"The silent one-clouded heavens drifted on to the sea. Now we were snow-blind travelers lost on the north hills, and vast dewlapped dogs, with flasks round their necks, ambled and shambled up to us, baying \"Excelsior.\" We returned home through the poor streets where only a few children fumbled with bare red fingers in the wheel-rutted snow and cat-called after us, their voices fading away, as we trudged uphill, into the cries of the dock birds and the hooting of ships out in the whirling bay. And then, at tea the recovered Uncles would be jolly; and the ice cake loomed in the center of the table like a marble grave. Auntie Hannah laced her tea with rum, because it was only once a year.Bring out the tall tales now that we told by the fire as the gaslight bubbled like a diver. Ghosts whooed like owls in the long nights when I dared not look over my shoulder; animals lurked in the cubbyhole under the stairs and the gas meter ticked. And I remember that we went singing carols once, when there wasn't the shaving of a moon to light the flying streets. At the end of a long road was a drive that led to a large house, and we stumbled up the darkness of the drive that night, each one of us afraid, each one holding a stone in his hand in case, and all of us too brave to say a word. The wind through the trees made noises as of old and unpleasant and maybe webfooted men wheezing in caves. We reached the black bulk of the house. \"What shall we give them? Hark the Herald?\"\"No,\" Jack said, \"Good King Wencelas. I'll count three.\" One, two three, and we began to sing, our voices high and seemingly distant in the snow-felted darkness round the house that was occupied by nobody we knew. We stood close together, near the dark door. Good King Wencelas looked out On the Feast of Stephen ... And then a small, dry voice, like the voice of someone who has not spoken for a long time, joined our singing: a small, dry, eggshell voice from the other side of the door: a small dry voice through the keyhole. And when we stopped running we were outside our house; the front room was lovely; balloons floated under the hot-water-bottle-gulping gas; everything was good again and shone over the town.\"Perhaps it was a ghost,\" Jim said. \"Perhaps it was trolls,\" Dan said, who was always reading.\"Let's go in and see if there's any jelly left,\" Jack said. And we did that.Always on Christmas night there was music. An uncle played the fiddle, a cousin sang \"Cherry Ripe,\" and another uncle sang \"Drake's Drum.\" It was very warm in the little house. Auntie Hannah, who had got on to the parsnip wine, sang a song about Bleeding Hearts and Death, and then another in which she said her heart was like a Bird's Nest; and then everybody laughed again; and then I went to bed. Looking through my bedroom window, out into the moonlight and the unending smoke-colored snow, I could see the lights in the windows of all the other houses on our hill and hear the music rising from them up the long, steady falling night. I turned the gas down, I got into bed. I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI never thought my life could beAnything but catastropheBut suddenly I begin to seeA bit of good luck for me'Cause I've got a golden ticketI've got a golden twinkle in my eyeI never had a chance to shineNever a happy song to singBut suddenly half the world is mineWhat an amazing thing'Cause I've got a golden ticketIt's ours, CharlieI've got a golden sun up in the skyI never thought I'd see the dayWhen I would face the world and sayGood morning, look at the sunI never thought that I would beSlap in the lap of luxury'Cause I'd have said it couldn't be doneBut it can be doneI never dreamed that I would climbOver the moon in ecstasyBut nevertheless, it's there that I'mShortly about to be'Cause I've got a golden ticketI've got a golden chance to make my wayAnd with a golden ticket, it's a golden dayGood morning, look at the sun'Cause I'd have said it couldn't be doneBut it can be doneI never dreamed that I would climbOver the moon in ecstasyBut nevertheless, it's there that I'mShortly about to be'Cause I've got a golden ticket'Cause I've got a golden ticketI've got a golden chance to make my wayAnd with a golden ticket, it's a golden day\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOcean, if you were to give, a measure, a ferment, a fruitof your gifts and destructions, into my hand,I would choose your far-off repose, your contour of steel,your vigilant spaces of air and darkness,and the power of your white tongue,that shatters and overthrows columns,breaking them down to your proper purity.Not the final breaker, heavy with brine,that thunders onshore, and createsthe silence of sand, that encircles the world,but the inner spaces of force,the naked power of the waters,the immoveable solitude, brimming with lives.It is Time perhaps, or the vessel filledwith all motion, pure Oneness,that death cannot touch, the visceral greenof consuming totality.Only a salt kiss remains of the drowned arm,that lifts a spray: a humid scent,of the damp flower, is left,from the bodies of men. Your energiesform, in a trickle that is not spent,form, in retreat into silence.The falling wave,arch of identity, shattering feathers,is only spume when it clears, and returns to its source, unconsumed.Your whole force heads for its origin.The husks that your load threshes,are only the crushed, plundered, deliveries,that your act of abundance expelled,all those that take life from your branches.Your form extends beyond breakers,vibrant, and rhythmic, like the chest, cloakinga single being, and its breathings,that lift into the content of light,plains raised above waves,forming the naked surface of earth.You fill your true self with your substance.You overflow curve with silence.The vessel trembles with your salt and sweetness,the universal cavern of waters,and nothing is lost from you, as it isfrom the desolate crater, or the bay of a hill,those empty heights, signs, scars,guarding the wounded air.Your petals throbbing against the Earth,trembling your submarine harvests,your menace thickening the smooth swell,with pulsations and swarming of schools,and only the thread of the net raisesthe dead lightning of fish-scale,one wounded millimetre, in the spaceof your crystal completeness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think, no matter where you stray,That I shall go with you a way.Though you may wander sweeter lands,You will not soon forget my hands,Nor yet the way I held my head,Nor all the tremulous things I said.You still will see me, small and whiteAnd smiling, in the secret night,And feel my arms about you whenThe day comes fluttering back again.I think, no matter where you be,You'll hold me in your memoryAnd keep my image, there without me,By telling later loves about me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI start nowars, raining poisonon cathedrals,melting Stars of Davidinto golden faucetsto be lighted by lampsshaded by human skin.I set nostore on the strange lands,send nomissionaries beyond myborders,to plunder secretsand barter souls.Theysay you took my manhood,Momma.Come sit on my lapand tell me,what do you want me to sayto them, justbefore I annihilatetheir ignorance ?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is the place.  Stand still, my steed,  Let me review the scene,And summon from the shadowy Past  The forms that once have been.The Past and Present here unite  Beneath Time's flowing tide,Like footprints hidden by a brook,  But seen on either side.Here runs the highway to the town;  There the green lane descends,Through which I walked to church with thee,  O gentlest of my friends!The shadow of the linden-trees  Lay moving on the grass;Between them and the moving boughs,  A shadow, thou didst pass.Thy dress was like the lilies,  And thy heart as pure as they:One of God's holy messengers  Did walk with me that day.I saw the branches of the trees  Bend down thy touch to meet,The clover-blossoms in the grass  Rise up to kiss thy feet,\"Sleep, sleep to-day, tormenting cares,  Of earth and folly born!\"Solemnly sang the village choir  On that sweet Sabbath morn.Through the closed blinds the golden sun  Poured in a dusty beam,Like the celestial ladder seen  By Jacob in his dream.And ever and anon, the wind,  Sweet-scented with the hay,Turned o'er the hymn-book's fluttering leaves That on the window lay.Long was the good man's sermon,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For he spake of Ruth the beautiful,  And still I thought of thee.Long was the prayer he uttered,  Yet it seemed not so to me;For in my heart I prayed with him,  And still I thought of thee.But now, alas! the place seems changed;  Thou art no longer here:Part of the sunshine of the scene  With thee did disappear.Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,  Like pine-trees dark and high,Subdue the light of noon, and breathe  A low and ceaseless sigh;This memory brightens o'er the past,  As when the sun, concealedBehind some cloud that near us hangs  Shines on a distant field.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rose is a rose,And was always a rose.But the theory now goesThat the apple's a rose,And the pear is, and so'sThe plum, I suppose.The dear only knowsWhat will next prove a rose.You, of course, are a rose -But were always a rose.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,We stopped by a mountain pasture to say 'Whose colt?'A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,The other curled at his breast. He dipped his headAnd snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.'I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow.He isn't winter-broken. It isn't playWith the little fellow at all. He's running away.I doubt if even his mother could tell him, 'Sakes,It's only weather'. He'd think she didn't know !Where is his mother? He can't be out alone.'And now he comes again with a clatter of stoneAnd mounts the wall again with whited eyesAnd all his tail that isn't hair up straight.He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.'Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,Ought to be told to come and take him in.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo whoever is not listening to the seathis Friday morning, to whoever is cooped upin house or office, factory or womanor street or mine or harsh prison cell;to him I come, and, without speaking or looking,I arrive and open the door of his prison,and a vibration starts up, vague and insistent,a great fragment of thunder sets in motionthe rumble of the planet and the foam,the raucous rivers of the ocean flood,the star vibrates swiftly in its corona,and the sea is beating, dying and continuing.So, drawn on by my destiny,I ceaselessly must listen to and keepthe sea's lamenting in my awareness,I must feel the crash of the hard waterand gather it up in a perpetual cupso that, wherever those in prison may be,wherever they suffer the autumn's castigation,I may be there with an errant wave,I may move, passing through windows,and hearing me, eyes will glance upwardsaying 'How can I reach the sea?'And I shall broadcast, saying nothing,the starry echoes of the wave,a breaking up of foam and quicksand,a rustling of salt withdrawing,the grey cry of the sea-birds on the coast.So, through me, freedom and the seawill make their answer to the shuttered heart.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe make ourselves a place apartBehind light words that tease and flout,But oh, the agitated heartTill someone find us really out.'Tis pity if the case require(Or so we say) that in the endWe speak the literal to inspireThe understanding of a friend.But so with all, from babes that playAt hide-and-seek to God afar,So all who hide too well awayMust speak and tell us where they are.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI met a traveller from an antique landWho said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor  well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.And on the pedestal these words appear --\"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\"Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI remember you as you were in the last autumn. You were the grey beret and the still heart.In your eyes the flames of the twilight fought on.And the leaves fell in the water of your soul.Clasping my arms like a climbing plantthe leaves garnered your voice, that was slow and at peace.Bonfire of awe in which my thirst was burning.Sweet blue hyacinth twisted over my soul.I feel your eyes traveling, and the autumn is far off:Grey beret, voice of a bird, heart like a houseTowards which my deep longings migratedAnd my kisses fell, happy as embers.Sky from a ship. Field from the hills:Your memory is made of light, of smoke, of a still pond!Beyond your eyes, farther on, the evenings were blazing.Dry autumn leaves revolved in your soul.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBRAVE flowers--that I could gallant it like you,     And be as little vain!You come abroad, and make a harmless show,     And to your beds of earth again.You are not proud: you know your birth:For your embroider'd garments are from earth.You do obey your months and times, but I     Would have it ever Spring:My fate would know no Winter, never die,     Nor think of such a thing.O that I could my bed of earth but viewAnd smile, and look as cheerfully as you!O teach me to see Death and not to fear,     But rather to take truce!How often have I seen you at a bier,     And there look fresh and spruce!You fragrant flowers! then teach me, that my breathLike yours may sweeten and perfume my death.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are many that I misshaving sent my last one out a car windowsparking along the road one night, years ago.The heralded one, of course:after sex, the two glowing tipsnow the lights of a single ship;at the end of a long dinnerwith more wine to comeand a smoke ring coasting into the chandelier;or on a white beach,holding one with fingers still wet from a swim.How bittersweet these punctuationsof flame and gesture;but the best were on those morningswhen I would have a little something goingin the typewriter,the sun bright in the windows,maybe some Berlioz on in the background.I would go into the kitchen for coffeeand on the way back to the page,curled in its roller,I would light one up and feelits dry rush mix with the dark taste of coffee.Then I would be my own locomotive,trailing behind me as I returned to worklittle puffs of smoke,indicators of progress,signs of industry and thought,the signal that told the nineteenth centuryit was moving forward.That was the best cigarette,when I would steam into the studyfull of vaporous hopeand stand there,the big headlamp of my facepointed down at all the words in parallel lines.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNothing can ever happen twice.In consequence, the sorry fact isthat we arrive here improvisedand leave without the chance to practice. Even if there is no one dumber,if you're the planet's biggest dunce,you can't repeat the class in summer:this course is only offered once. No day copies yesterday,no two nights will teach what bliss isin precisely the same way,with precisely the same kisses. One day, perhaps some idle tonguementions your name by accident:I feel as if a rose were flunginto the room, all hue and scent. The next day, though you're here with me,I can't help looking at the clock:A rose? A rose? What could that be?Is it a flower or a rock? Why do we treat the fleeting daywith so much needless fear and sorrow?It's in its nature not to stay:Today is always gone tomorrow. With smiles and kisses, we preferto seek accord beneath our star,although we're different (we concur)just as two drops of water are. translated by Clare Cavanagh and Stanislaw Baranczak\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman poweris Black powerisHuman powerisalwasy feelingmy heart beatsas my eyes openas my hands moveas my mouth speaksI amare youReady.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf we must die, let it not be like hogsHunted and penned in an inglorious spot,While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,Making their mock at our accursèd lot.If we must die, O let us nobly die,So that our precious blood may not be shedIn vain; then even the monsters we defyShall be constrained to honor us though dead!O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!What though before us lies the open grave?Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack,Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpades take up leavesNo better than spoons,And bags full of leavesAre light as balloons.I make a great noiseOf rustling all dayLike rabbit and deerRunning away.But the mountains I raiseElude my embrace,Flowing over my armsAnd into my face.I may load and unloadAgain and againTill I fill the whole shed,And what have I then?Next to nothing for weight,And since they grew dullerFrom contact with earth,Next to nothing for color.Next to nothing for use.But a crop is a crop,And who's to say whereThe harvest shall stop?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI do not love you except because I love you; I go from loving to not loving you,From waiting to not waiting for youMy heart moves from cold to fire.I love you only because it's you the one I love; I hate you deeply, and hating youBend to you, and the measure of my changing love for youIs that I do not see you but love you blindly.Maybe January light will consumeMy heart with its cruelRay, stealing my key to true calm.In this part of the story I am the one whoDies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,Because I love you, Love, in fire and blood.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWEAVERS, weaving at break of day, Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . .

He knew the code:His hate had roused an engine up the road.He wished when he had had the track aloneHe had attacked it with a club or stoneAnd bent some rail wide open like switchSo as to wreck the engine in the ditch.Too late though, now, he had himself to thank.Its click was rising to a nearer clank.Here it came breasting like a horse in skirts.(He stood well back for fear of scalding squirts.)Then for a moment all there was was sizeConfusion and a roar that drowned the criesHe raised against the gods in the machine.Then once again the sandbank lay serene.The traveler's eye picked up a turtle train,between the dotted feet a streak of tail,And followed it to where he made out vagueBut certain signs of buried turtle's egg;And probing with one finger not too rough,He found suspicious sand, and sure enough,The pocket of a little turtle mine.If there was one egg in it there were nine,Torpedo-like, with shell of gritty leatherAll packed in sand to wait the trump together.'You'd better not disturb any more,'He told the distance, 'I am armed for war.The next machine that has the power to passWill get this plasm in it goggle glass.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI dream a world where manNo other man will scorn,Where love will bless the earthAnd peace its paths adornI dream a world where allWill know sweet freedom's way,Where greed no longer saps the soulNor avarice blights our day.A world I dream where black or white,Whatever race you be,Will share the bounties of the earthAnd every man is free,Where wretchedness will hang its headAnd joy, like a pearl,Attends the needs of all mankind-Of such I dream, my world!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI had a little nut-tree,Nothing would it bear.I searched in all its branches,But not a nut was there.'Oh, little tree,' I begged,'Give me just a few.'The little tree looked down at meAnd whispered, 'Nuts to you.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen it hurts so bad, why does it feel so good?

Loving you feels so right, but at the same time, knowing I can't have you keeps me awake at night.I just want this to be simple, I just want you here with me, to look into your eyes, be held in your arms...then I'd truly be happy.Right now this distance between us is out of our control, but I'm still hoping one day soon, I'll get what I'm wishing for.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tXIVIf thou must love me, let it be for noughtExcept for love's sake only.

You want to see him safe.''You like the runt.''Don't you a little?''Well,I don't like what he's doing, which is whatYou like, and like him for.''Oh, yes you do.You like your fun as well as anyone;Only you women have to put these airs onTo impress men.

Go inAnd save his life.- All right, come in, Meserve.Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?''Fine, fine.''And ready for some more? My wife hereSays it won't do. You've got to give it up.''Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to your wife.What did your wife say on the telephone?'Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lampOr something not far from it on the table.By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,He pointed with his hand from where it layLike a white crumpled spider on his knee:'That leaf there in your open book! It movedJust then, I thought. It's stood erect like that,There on the table, ever since I came,Trying to turn itself backward or forward,I've had my eye on it to make out which;If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience-You see I know-to get you on to thingsIt wants to see how you will take, if backwardIt's from regret for something you have passedAnd failed to see the good of. Never mind,Things must expect to come in front of usA many times-I don't say just how many-That varies with the things-before we see them.One of the lies would make it out that nothingEver presents itself before us twice.Where would we be at last if that were so?Our very life depends on everything'sRecurring till we answer from within.The thousandth time may prove the charm.- That leaf!It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.But the wind didn't move it if it moved.It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.It couldn't stir so sensitively poisedA thing as that. It couldn't reach the lampTo get a puff of black smoke from the flame,Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.You make a little foursquare block of air,Quiet and light and warm, in spite of allThe illimitable dark and cold and storm,And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;Though for all anyone can tell, reposeMay be the thing you haven't, yet you give it.So false it is that what we haven't we can't give;So false, that what we always say is true.I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?''I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,But if you're going- Say you'll stay, you know?But let me raise this curtain on a scene,And show you how it's piling up against you.You see the snow-white through the white of frost?Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbedSince last we read the gage.''It looks as ifSome pallid thing had squashed its features flatAnd its eyes shut with overeagernessTo see what people found so interestingIn one another, and had gone to sleepOf its own stupid lack of understanding,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuffShort off, and died against the window-pane.''Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourselfMore than you will us with such nightmare talk.It's you it matters to, because it's youWho have to go out into it alone.''Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay.''Before you drop the curtain-I'm reminded:You recollect the boy who came out hereTo breathe the air one winter-had a roomDown at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morningAfter a downy storm, he passed our placeAnd found me banking up the house with snow.And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,Piling it well above the window-sills.The snow against the window caught his eye.'Hey, that's a pretty thought'-those were his words.'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.You can't get too much winter in the winter.'Those were his words. And he went home and allBut banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.Now you and I would go to no such length.At the same time you can't deny it makesIt not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,Playing our fancy, to have the snowline runSo high across the pane outside. There whereThere is a sort of tunnel in the frostMore like a tunnel than a hole-way downAt the far end of it you see a stirAnd quiver like the frayed edge of the driftBlown in the wind. I like that-I like that.Well, now I leave you, people.''Come, Meserve,We thought you were deciding not to go-The ways you found to say the praise of comfortAnd being where you are. You want to stay.''I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.This house is frozen brittle, all exceptThis room you sit in. If you think the windSounds further off, it's not because it's dying;You're further under in the snow-that's all-And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dustIt bursts against us at the chimney mouth,And at the eaves. I like it from insideMore than I shall out in it. But the horsesAre rested and it's time to say good-night,And let you get to bed again. Good-night,Sorry I had to break in on your sleep.''Lucky for you you did. Lucky for youYou had us for a half-way stationTo stop at. If you were the kind of manPaid heed to women, you'd take my adviceAnd for your family's sake stay where you are.But what good is my saying it over and over?You've done more than you had a right to thinkYou could do-now. You know the risk you takeIn going on.''Our snow-storms as a ruleAren't looked on as man-killers, and althoughI'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleepUnder it all, his door sealed up and lost,Than the man fighting it to keep above it,Yet think of the small birds at roost and notIn nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?Their bulk in water would be frozen rockIn no time out to-night. And yet to-morrowThey will come budding boughs from tree to treeFlirting their wings and saying Chickadee,As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.''But why when no one wants you to go on?Your wife-she doesn't want you to. We don't,And you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?''Save us from being cornered by a woman.Well, there's'-She told Fred afterward that inThe pause right there, she thought the dreaded wordWas coming, 'God.' But no, he only said'Well, there's-the storm. That says I must go on.That wants me as a war might if it came.Ask any man.'He threw her that as somethingTo last her till he got outside the door.He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.When Cole returned he found his wife still standingBeside the table near the open book,Not reading it.'Well, what kind of a manDo you call that?' she said.'He had the giftOf words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?''Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?''Or disregarding people's civil questions-What? We've found out in one hour more about himThan we had seeing him pass by in the roadA thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!You didn't think you'd keep him after all.Oh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave youMuch say in the matter, and I'm just as gladWe're not in for a night of him. No sleepIf he had stayed. The least thing set him going.It's quiet as an empty church without him.''But how much better off are we as it is?We'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.''Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't.He knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try.Get into bed I say, and get some rest.He won't come back, and if he telephones,It won't be for an hour or two.''Well then- We can't be any help by sitting hereAnd living his fight through with him, I suppose.'- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Cole had been telephoning in the dark.Mrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:'Did she call you or you call her?''She me.You'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.We must have been asleep: it's three and after.''Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper.I want to speak to her.''All she said was,He hadn't come and had he really started.''She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.''He had the shovel. He'll have made a fight.''Why did I ever let him leave this house!''Don't begin that. You did the best you couldTo keep him-though perhaps you didn't quiteConceal a wish to see him show the spunkTo disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you.''Fred, after all I said! You shan't make outThat it was any way but what it was.Did she let on by any word she saidShe didn't thank me?''When I told her 'Gone,''Well then,' she said, and 'Well then'-like a threat.And then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you,Why did you let him go'?''Asked why we let him?You let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.She didn't dare to speak when he was here.Their number's-twenty-one? The thing won't work.Someone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles.The stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!It's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and gone.''Try speaking. Say 'Hello'!''Hello. Hello.''What do you hear?''I hear an empty room-You know-it sounds that way. And yes, I hear-I think I hear a clock-and windows rattling.No step though. If she's there she's sitting down.''Shout, she may hear you.''Shouting is no good.''Keep speaking then.''Hello. Hello. Hello.You don't suppose-? She wouldn't go out doors?''I'm half afraid that's just what she might do.''And leave the children?''Wait and call again.You can't hear whether she has left the doorWide open and the wind's blown out the lampAnd the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?''One of two things, either she's gone to bedOr gone out doors.''In which case both are lost.Do you know what she's like? Have you ever met her?It's strange she doesn't want to speak to us.''Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.''A clock maybe.''Don't you hear something else?''Not talking.''No.''Why, yes, I hear-what is it?''What do you say it is?''A baby's crying!Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.''Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,Not if she's there.''What do you make of it?''There's only one thing possible to make,That is, assuming-that she has gone out.Of course she hasn't though.' They both sat downHelpless. 'There's nothing we can do till morning.''Fred, I shan't let you think of going out.''Hold on.' The double bell began to chirp.They started up. Fred took the telephone.'Hello, Meserve. You're there, then!-And your wife?Good! Why I asked-she didn't seem to answer.He says she went to let him in the barn.-We're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.Drop in and see us when you're passing.''Well,She has him then, though what she wants him forI don't see.''Possibly not for herself.Maybe she only wants him for the children.''The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.What did he come in for?-To talk and visit?Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.If he thinks he is going to make our houseA halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere- ''I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned.''You think you haven't been concerned yourself.''If you mean he was inconsiderateTo rout us out to think for him at midnightAnd then take our advice no more than nothing,Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him.We've had a share in one night of his life.What'll you bet he ever calls again?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'My teacher wasn't half as nice as yours seems to be.His name was Mister Unsworth and he taught us history.And when you didn't know a date he'd get you by the earAnd start to twist while you sat there quite paralysed with fear.He'd twist and twist and twist your ear and twist it more and more.Until at last the ear came off and landed on the floor.Our class was full of one-eared boys. I'm certain there were eight.Who'd had them twisted off because they didn't know a date.So let us now praise teachers who today are all so fineAnd yours in particular is totally divine.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis saltin the salt cellarI once saw in the salt mines.I knowyou won'tbelieve mebutit singssalt sings, the skinof the salt minessingswith a mouth smotheredby the earth.I shivered in thosesolitudeswhen I heardthe voiceofthe salt in the desert.Near Antofagastathe nitrouspamparesounds:abrokenvoice,a mournfulsong.In its cavesthe salt moans, mountainof buried light,translucent cathedral,crystal of the sea, oblivionof the waves.And then on every tablein the world,salt,we see your piquantpowdersprinklingvital lightuponour food.

the best of them to-night, By setting fire to all the brush we piled With pitchy hands to wait for rain or snow. Oh, let’s not wait for rain to make it safe. The pile is ours: we dragged it bough on bough Down dark converging paths between the pines. Let’s not care what we do with it to-night. Divide it? No! But burn it as one pile The way we piled it. And let’s be the talk Of people brought to windows by a light Thrown from somewhere against their wall-paper. Rouse them all, both the free and not so free With saying what they’d like to do to us For what they’d better wait till we have done. Let’s all but bring to life this old volcano, If that is what the mountain ever was— And scare ourselves. Let wild fire loose we will….” “And scare you too?” the children said together. “Why wouldn’t it scare me to have a fire Begin in smudge with ropy smoke and know That still, if I repent, I may recall it, But in a moment not: a little spurt Of burning fatness, and then nothing but The fire itself can put it out, and that By burning out, and before it burns out It will have roared first and mixed sparks with stars, And sweeping round it with a flaming sword, Made the dim trees stand back in wider circle— Done so much and I know not how much more I mean it shall not do if I can bind it. Well if it doesn’t with its draft bring on A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter, As once it did with me upon an April. The breezes were so spent with winter blowing They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them Short of the perch their languid flight was toward; And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven As I walked once round it in possession. But the wind out of doors—you know the saying. There came a gust. You used to think the trees Made wind by fanning since you never knew It blow but that you saw the trees in motion. Something or someone watching made that gust. It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass Of over-winter with the least tip-touch Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand. The place it reached to blackened instantly. The black was all there was by day-light, That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke— And a flame slender as the hepaticas, Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now. But the black spread like black death on the ground, And I think the sky darkened with a cloud Like winter and evening coming on together. There were enough things to be thought of then. Where the field stretches toward the north And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it To flames without twice thinking, where it verges Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear They might find fuel there, in withered brake, Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod, And alder and grape vine entanglement, To leap the dusty deadline. For my own I took what front there was beside. I knelt And thrust hands in and held my face away. Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating. A board is the best weapon if you have it. I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew, And said out loud, I couldn’t bide the smother And heat so close in; but the thought of all The woods and town on fire by me, and all The town turned out to fight for me—that held me. I trusted the brook barrier, but feared The road would fail; and on that side the fire Died not without a noise of crackling wood— Of something more than tinder-grass and weed— That brought me to my feet to hold it back By leaning back myself, as if the reins Were round my neck and I was at the plough. I won! But I’m sure no one ever spread Another color over a tenth the space That I spread coal-black over in the time It took me. Neighbors coming home from town Couldn’t believe that so much black had come there While they had backs turned, that it hadn’t been there When they had passed an hour or so before Going the other way and they not seen it. They looked about for someone to have done it. But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering Where all my weariness had gone and why I walked so light on air in heavy shoes In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling. Why wouldn’t I be scared remembering that?” “If it scares you, what will it do to us?” “Scare you. But if you shrink from being scared, What would you say to war if it should come? That’s what for reasons I should like to know— If you can comfort me by any answer.” “Oh, but war’s not for children—it’s for men.” “Now we are digging almost down to China. My dears, my dears, you thought that—we all thought it. So your mistake was ours. Haven’t you heard, though, About the ships where war has found them out At sea, about the towns where war has come Through opening clouds at night with droning speed Further o’erhead than all but stars and angels,— And children in the ships and in the towns? Haven’t you heard what we have lived to learn? Nothing so new—something we had forgotten: War is for everyone, for children too. I wasn’t going to tell you and I mustn’t. The best way is to come up hill with me And have our fire and laugh and be afraid.”\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow close the windows and hush all the fields:If the trees must, let them silently toss;No bird is singing now, and if there is,Be it my loss.It will be long ere the marshes resume,I will be long ere the earliest bird:So close the windows and not hear the wind,But see all wind-stirred.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Help, help, ' said a man.

\"\"Not too bad - but far too long.The technique was fine of course,But it lacked a certain force\".\"Oh! \" the nightingale confessed.Greatly flattered and impressedThat a critic of such noteHad discussed her art and throat:\"I don't think the song's divine.But - oh, well - at least it's mine\".\"That's not much to boast about\".Said the heartless frog. \"WithoutProper training such as I- And few others can supply.You'll remain a mere beginner.But with me you'll be a winner\"\"Dearest frog\", the nightingaleBreathed: \"This is a fairy tale -And you are Mozart in disguiseCome to earth before my eyes\".\"Well I charge a modest fee.\"\"Oh! \" \"But it won't hurt, you'll see\"Now the nightingale inspired,Flushed with confidence, and firedWith both art and adoration,Sang - and was a huge sensation.Animals for miles aroundFlocked towards the magic sound,And the frog with great precisionCounted heads and charged admission.Though next morning it was raining,He began her vocal training.\"But I can't sing in this weather\"\"Come my dear - we'll sing together.Just put on your scarf and sash,Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"So the frog and nightingaleJourneyed up and down the scaleFor six hours, till she was shiveringand her voice was hoarse and quivering.Though subdued and sleep deprived,In the night her throat revived,And the sumac tree was bowed,With a breathless, titled crowd:Owl of Sandwich, Duck of Kent,Mallard and Milady Trent,Martin Cardinal Mephisto,And the Coot of Monte Cristo,Ladies with tiaras glitteringIn the interval sat twittering -And the frog observed them glitterWith a joy both sweet and bitter.Every day the frog who'd sold herSongs for silver tried to scold her:\"You must practice even longerTill your voice, like mine grows stronger.In the second song last nightYou got nervous in mid-flight.And, my dear, lay on more trills:Audiences enjoy such frills.You must make your public happier:Give them something sharper snappier.We must aim for better billings.You still owe me sixty shillings.\"Day by day the nightingaleGrew more sorrowful and pale.Night on night her tired songZipped and trilled and bounced along,Till the birds and beasts grew tiredAt a voice so uninspiredAnd the ticket office grossCrashed, and she grew more morose -For her ears were now addictedTo applause quite unrestricted,And to sing into the nightAll alone gave no delight.Now the frog puffed up with rage.\"Brainless bird - you're on the stage -Use your wits and follow fashion.Puff your lungs out with your passion.\"Trembling, terrified to fail,Blind with tears, the nightingaleHeard him out in silence, tried,Puffed up, burst a vein, and died.Said the frog: \"I tried to teach her,But she was a stupid creature -Far too nervous, far too tense.Far too prone to influence.Well, poor bird - she should have knownThat your song must be your own.That's why I sing with panache:\"Koo-oh-ah! ko-ash! ko-ash! \"And the foghorn of the frogBlared unrivalled through the bog.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death.I hear him leading his horse out of the stall; I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.But I will not hold the bridlewhile he clinches the girth.And he may mount by himself: I will not give him a leg up. Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,I will not tell him which way the fox ran.With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where the black boy hides in the swamp.I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;I am not on his pay-roll. I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends nor of my enemies either.Though he promise me much, I will not map him the route to any man's door.Am I a spy in the land of the living,that I should deliver men to Death?Brother, the password and the plans of our city are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn the morning the citySpreads its wingsMaking a songIn stone that sings.In the evening the cityGoes to bedHanging lights Above its head.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI saw you toss the kites on high And blow the birds about the sky; And all around I heard you pass, Like ladies' skirts across the grass-- O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song! I saw the different things you did, But always you yourself you hid. I felt you push, I heard you call, I could not see yourself at all-- O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song! O you that are so strong and cold, O blower, are you young or old? Are you a beast of field and tree, Or just a stronger child than me? O wind, a-blowing all day long, O wind, that sings so loud a song!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNOW that they've got it settled whose I be,I'm going to tell them something they won't like:They've got it settled wrong, and I can prove it.Flattered I must be to have two towns fightingTo make a present of me to each other.They don't dispose me, either one of them,To spare them any trouble. Double trouble'sAlways the witch's motto anyway.I'll double theirs for both of them- you watch me.They'll find they've got the whole thing to do over,That is, if facts is what they want to go by.They set a lot (now don't they?) by a recordOf Arthur Amy's having once been upFor Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.I could have told them any time this twelvemonthThe Arthur Amy I was married toCouldn't have been the one they say was upIn Warren at March Meeting for the reasonHe wa'n't but fifteen at the time they say.The Arthur Amy I was married tovoted the only times he ever voted,Which wasn't many, in the town of Wentworth.One of the times was when 'twas in the warrantTo see if the town wanted to take overThe tote road to our clearing where we lived.I'll tell you who'd remember- Heman Lapish.Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.So now they've dragged it through the law courts onceI guess they'd better drag it through again.Wentworth and Warren's both good towns to live in,Only I happen to prefer to liveIn Wentworth from now on; and when all's said,Right's right, and the temptation to do rightWhen I can hurt someone by doing itHas always been too much for me, it has.I know of some folks that'd be set upAt having in their town a noted witch:But most would have to think of the expenseThat even I would be. They ought to knowThat as a witch I'd often milk a batAnd that'd be enough to last for days.It'd make my position stronger, I think,If I was to consent to give some signTo make it surer that I was a witch?It wa'n't no sign, I s'pose, when Mallice HuseSaid that I took him out in his old ageAnd rode all over everything on himUntil I'd had him worn to skin and bones,And if I'd left him hitched unblanketedIn front of one Town Hall, I'd left him hitchedIn front of every one in Grafton County.Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,The poor old man. It would have been all rightIf some one hadn't said to gnaw the postsHe stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,So they could recognize them. Not a postThat they could hear tell of was scarified.They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.Then that same smarty someone said to look- He'd bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawedThe crib he slept in- and as sure's you're bornThey found he'd gnawed the four posts of his bed,All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?Not that he hadn't gnawed the hitching postsHe said he had besides. Because a horseGnaws in the stable ain't no proof to meHe don't gnaw trees and posts and fences too.But everybody took it for proof.I was a strapping girl of twenty then.The smarty someone who spoiled everythingWas Arthur Amy. You know who he was.That was the way he started courting me.He never said much after we were married,But I mistrusted he was none too proudOf having interfered in the Huse business.I guess he found he got more out of meBy having me a witch. Or something happenedTo turn him round. He got to saying thingsTo undo what he'd done and make it right,Like, 'No, she ain't come back from kiting yet.Last night was one of her nights out. She's kiting.She thinks when the wind makes a night of itShe might as well herself.' But he liked bestTo let on he was plagued to death with me:If anyone had seen me coming homeOver the ridgepole, 'stride of a broomstick,As often as he had in the tail of the night,He guessed they'd know what he had to put up with.Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enoughOff from the house as far as we could keepAnd from barn smells you can't wash out of ploughed groundWith all the rain and snow of seven years;And I don't mean just skulls of Roger's RangersOn Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,Only bewitched so I would last him longer.Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,I made him gather me wet snow berriesOn slippery rocks beside a waterfall.I made him do it for me in the dark.And he liked everything I made him do.I hope if he is where he sees me nowHe's so far off he can't see what I've come to.You _can_ come down from everything to nothing.All is, if I'd a-known when I was youngAnd full of it, that this would be the end,It doesn't seem as if I'd had the courageTo make so free and kick up in folks' faces.I might have, but it doesn't seem as if.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCome to me in my dreams, and then By day I shall be well again! For so the night will more than pay The hopeless longing of the day.Come, as thou cam'st a thousand times, A messenger from radiant climes, And smile on thy new world, and be As kind to others as to me!Or, as thou never cam'st in sooth, Come now, and let me dream it truth, And part my hair, and kiss my brow, And say, My love why sufferest thou?Come to me in my dreams, and then By day I shall be well again! For so the night will more than pay The hopeless longing of the day.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI love chocolate cake.And when I was a boyI loved it even more.Sometimes we used to have it for teaand Mum used to say,'If there's any left overyou can have it to take to schooltomorrow to have at playtime.'And the next day I would take it to schoolwrapped up in tin foilopen it up at playtimeand sit in the corner of the playgroundeating it,you know how the icing on topis all shiny and it cracks as youbite into it,and there's that other kind of icing inthe middleand it sticks to your hands and youcan lick your fingersand lick your lipsoh it's lovely.yeah.Anyway,once we had this chocolate cake for teaand later I went to bedbut while I was in bedI found myself waking uplicking my lipsand smiling.I woke up proper.'The chocolate cake.'It was the first thing1 thought of.I could almost see itso I thought,what if I go downstairsand have a little nibble, yeah?It was all darkeveryone was in bedso it must have been really latebut I got out of bed,crept out of the doorthere's always a creaky floorboard, isn't there?Past Mum and Dad's room,careful not to tread on bits of broken toysor bits of Legoyou know what it's like treading on Legowith your bare feet,yowwwwshhhhhhhdownstairsinto the kitchenopen the cupboardand there it isall shining.So I take it out of the cupboardput it on the tableand I see thatthere's a few crumbs lying about on the plate,so I lick my finger and run my finger all over the crumbsscooping them upand put them into my mouth.oooooooommmmmmmmmnice.ThenI look againand on one side where it's been cut,it's all crumbly.So I take a knifeI think I'll just tidy that up a bit,cut off the crumbly bitsscoop them all upand into the mouthoooooommm mmmmnice.Look at the cake again.That looks a bit funny now,one side doesn't match the otherI'll just even it up a bit, eh?Take the knifeand slice.This time the knife makes a little cracky noiseas it goes through that hard icing on top.A whole slice this time,into the mouth.Oh the icing on topand the icing in the middleohhhhhh oooo mmmmmm.But nowI can't stop myselfKnife -1 just take any old slice at itand I've got this great big chunkand I'm cramming it inwhat a greedy pigbut it's so nice,and there's anotherand another and I'm squealing and I'm smacking my lipsand I'm stuffing myself with itandbefore I knowI've eaten the lot.The whole lot.I look at the plate.It's all gone.Oh nothey're bound to notice, aren't they,a whole chocolate cake doesn't just disappeardoes it?What shall 1 do?I know. I'll wash the plate up,and the knifeand put them away and maybe no onewill notice, eh?So I do thatand creep creep creepback to bedinto beddoze offlicking my lipswith a lovely feeling in my belly.Mmmmrnmmmmm.In the morning I get up,downstairs,have breakfast,Mum's saying,'Have you got your dinner money?'and I say,'Yes.''And don't forget to take some chocolate cake with you.'I stopped breathing.'What's the matter,' she says,'you normally jump at chocolate cake?'I'm still not breathing,and she's looking at me very closely now.She's looking at me just below my mouth.'What's that?' she says.'What's what?' I say.'What's that there?''Where?''There,' she says, pointing at my chin.'I don't know,' I say.'It looks like chocolate,' she says.'It's not chocolate is it?'No answer.'Is it?''I don't know.'She goes to the cupboardlooks in, up, top, middle, bottom,turns back to me.'It's gone.It's gone.You haven't eaten it, have you?''I don't know.''You don't know. You don't know if you've eaten a wholechocolate cake or not?When? When did you eat it?'So I told her,and she saidwell what could she say?'That's the last time I give you any cake to taketo school.Now go. Get outno waitnot before you've washed your dirty sticky face.'I went upstairslooked in the mirrorand there it was,just below my mouth,a chocolate smudge.The give-away.Maybe she'll forget about it by next week.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTremors of your network cause kings to disappear. Your open mouth in anger makes nations bow in fear.Your bombs can change the seasons, obliterate the spring. What more do you long for ? Why are you suffering ?You control the human lives in Rome and Timbuktu. Lonely nomads wandering owe Telstar to you.Seas shift at your bidding, your mushrooms fill the sky. Why are you unhappy ? Why do your children cry ?They kneel alone in terror with dread in every glance. Their nights ['rights' ? - Schrift nicht lesbar] are threatened daily by a grim inheritance.You dwell in whitened castles with deep and poisoned moats and cannot hear the curses which fill your children's throats.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he      knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so      much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my      state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that.  The      church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she      does belongs to all.  When she baptizes a child, that action      concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which      is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member.      And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is      of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is      not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language;      and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several      translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness,      some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every      translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves      again for that library where every book shall lie open to one      another.  As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not      upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this      bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the      door by this sickness.  There was a contention as far as a suit (in      which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were      mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers      first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring      first that rose earliest.  If we understand aright the dignity of      this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to      make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be      ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.  The bell doth toll for him      that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that      minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God.      Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes      off his eye from a comet when that breaks out?  Who bends not his      ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove      it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this      world?  No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece      of the continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by      the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as      well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's      death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and      therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for      thee.  Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing      of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but      must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the      misery of our neighbours.  Truly it were an excusable covetousness      if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath      enough of it.  No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and      ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction.  If a man      carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none      coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he      travels.  Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not      current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our      home, heaven, by it.  Another man may be sick too, and sick to      death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a      mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his      affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this      consideration of another's danger I take mine own into      contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my      God, who is our only security.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNegroes,Sweet and docile,Meek, humble and kind:Beware the dayThey change their mind!WindIn the cotton fields,Gentle Breeze:Beware the hourIt uproots trees!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness Were in each of them. Even the crows were so Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in Attics and the urine of lizards and mice.... [From Summer in Calcutta]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough every nook and every crannyThe wind blew in on poor old GrannyAround her knees, into each ear(And up nose as well, I fear)All through the night the wind grew worseIt nearly made the vicar curseThe top had fallen off the steepleJust missing him (and other people)It blew on man, it blew on beastIt blew on nun, it blew on priestIt blew the wig off Auntie Fanny-But most of all, it blew on Granny!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnger, as black as a hook, overtakes me. Each day, each Nazitook, at 8: 00 A.M., a babyand sauteed him for breakfastin his frying pan. And death looks on with a casual eyeand picks at the dirt under his fingernail. Man is evil, I say aloud.Man is a flowerthat should be burnt, I say aloud.Manis a bird full of mud, I say aloud. And death looks on with a casual eyeand scratches his anus. Man with his small pink toes, with his miraculous fingersis not a templebut an outhouse, I say aloud.Let man never again raise his teacup.Let man never again write a book.Let man never again put on his shoe.Let man never again raise his eyes, on a soft July night.Never. Never. Never. Never. Never.I say those things aloud. I beg the Lord not to hear.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI1 Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knife us ... 2 Wearied we keep awake because the night is silent ...3 Low drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient ...4 Worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous,5   But nothing happens.6 Watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire.7 Like twitching agonies of men among its brambles.8 Northward incessantly, the flickering gunnery rumbles,9 Far off, like a dull rumour of some other war.10   What are we doing here?11 The poignant misery of dawn begins to grow ...12 We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy.13 Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army14 Attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray,15   But nothing happens. 16 Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence.17 Less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow,18 With sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause and renew,19 We watch them wandering up and down the wind's nonchalance,20   But nothing happens. II21 Pale flakes with lingering stealth come feeling for our faces--22 We cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed,23 Deep into grassier ditches. So we drowse, sun-dozed,24 Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses.25   Is it that we are dying?26 Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires glozed27 With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;28 For hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs;29 Shutters and doors all closed: on us the doors are closed--30   We turn back to our dying.31 Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;32 Now ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit.33 For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;34 Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,35   For love of God seems dying.36 To-night, His frost will fasten on this mud and us,37 Shrivelling many hands and puckering foreheads crisp.38 The burying-party, picks and shovels in their shaking grasp,39 Pause over half-known faces. All their eyes are ice,40   But nothing happens.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll round me are words, and words and words,They grow on me like leaves, they neverSeem to stop their slow growingFrom within... But I tell my self, wordsAre a nuisance, beware of them, theyCan be so many things, aChasm where running feet must pause, toLook, a sea with paralyzing waves,A blast of burning air or,A knife most willing to cut your bestFriend's throat... Words are a nuisance, but.They grow on me like leaves ona tree,They never seem to stop their coming,From a silence, somewhere deep within...\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe most important thing we've learned, So far as children are concerned, Is never, NEVER, NEVER let Them near your television set -- Or better still, just don't install The idiotic thing at all. In almost every house we've been, We've watched them gaping at the screen. They loll and slop and lounge about, And stare until their eyes pop out. (Last week in someone's place we saw A dozen eyeballs on the floor.) They sit and stare and stare and sit Until they're hypnotised by it, Until they're absolutely drunk With all that shocking ghastly junk. Oh yes, we know it keeps them still, They don't climb out the window sill, They never fight or kick or punch, They leave you free to cook the lunch And wash the dishes in the sink -- But did you ever stop to think, To wonder just exactly what This does to your beloved tot? IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD! IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD! IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND! IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND! HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE! HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE! HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES! 'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say, 'But if we take the set away, What shall we do to entertain Our darling children? Please explain!' We'll answer this by asking you, 'What used the darling ones to do? 'How used they keep themselves contented Before this monster was invented?' Have you forgotten? Don't you know? We'll say it very loud and slow: THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ, AND READ and READ, and then proceed To READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks! One half their lives was reading books! The nursery shelves held books galore! Books cluttered up the nursery floor! And in the bedroom, by the bed, More books were waiting to be read! Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales And treasure isles, and distant shores Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars, And pirates wearing purple pants, And sailing ships and elephants, And cannibals crouching 'round the pot, Stirring away at something hot. (It smells so good, what can it be? Good gracious, it's Penelope.) The younger ones had Beatrix Potter With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter, And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland, And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and- Just How The Camel Got His Hump, And How the Monkey Lost His Rump, And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul, There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole- Oh, books, what books they used to know, Those children living long ago! So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install A lovely bookshelf on the wall. Then fill the shelves with lots of books, Ignoring all the dirty looks, The screams and yells, the bites and kicks, And children hitting you with sticks- Fear not, because we promise you That, in about a week or two Of having nothing else to do, They'll now begin to feel the need Of having something to read. And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy! You watch the slowly growing joy That fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen They'll wonder what they'd ever seen In that ridiculous machine, That nauseating, foul, unclean, Repulsive television screen! And later, each and every kid Will love you more for what you did.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you came, you were like red wine and honey, And the taste of you burnt my mouth with its sweetness. Now you are like morning bread, Smooth and pleasant. I hardly taste you at all for I know your savour, But I am completely nourished.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIN due observance of an ancient rite,The rude Biscayans, when their children lieDead in the sinless time of infancy,Attire the peaceful corse in vestments white;And, in like sign of cloudless triumph bright,They bind the unoffending creature's browsWith happy garlands of the pure white rose:Then do a festal company uniteIn choral song; and, while the uplifted crossOf Jesus goes before, the child is borne Uncovered to his grave: 'tis closed,--her lossThe Mother 'then' mourns, as she needs must mourn;But soon, through Christian faith, is grief subdued;And joy returns, to brighten fortitude.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLying, thinkingLast nightHow to find my soul a homeWhere water is not thirstyAnd bread loaf is not stoneI came up with one thingAnd I don't believe I'm wrongThat nobody,But nobodyCan make it out here alone.Alone, all aloneNobody, but nobodyCan make it out here alone.There are some millionairesWith money they can't useTheir wives run round like bansheesTheir children sing the bluesThey've got expensive doctorsTo cure their hearts of stone.But nobodyNo, nobodyCan make it out here alone.Alone, all aloneNobody, but nobodyCan make it out here alone.Now if you listen closelyI'll tell you what I knowStorm clouds are gatheringThe wind is gonna blowThe race of man is sufferingAnd I can hear the moan,'Cause nobody,But nobodyCan make it out here alone.Alone, all aloneNobody, but nobodyCan make it out here alone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSouth of my days' circle, part of my blood's country,rises that tableland, high delicate outlineof bony slopes wincing under the winter,low trees, blue-leaved and olive, outcropping granite-clean, lean, hungry country. The creek's leaf-silenced,willow choked, the slope a tangle of medlar and crabapplebranching over and under, blotched with a green lichen;and the old cottage lurches in for shelter.O cold the black-frost night. The walls draw in to the warmthand the old roof cracks its joints; the slung kettlehisses a leak on the fire. Hardly to be believed that summer will turn up again some day in a wave of rambler-roses,thrust it's hot face in here to tell another yarn-a story old Dan can spin into a blanket against the winter.Seventy years of stories he clutches round his bones.Seventy years are hived in him like old honey.Droving that year, Charleville to the Hunter,nineteen-one it was, and the drought beginning;sixty head left at the McIntyre, the mud round themhardened like iron; and the yellow boy diedin the sulky ahead with the gear, but the horse went on,stopped at Sandy Camp and waited in the evening.It was the flies we seen first, swarming like bees.Came to the Hunter, three hundred head of a thousand-cruel to keep them alive - and the river was dust.Or mustering up in the Bogongs in the autumnwhen the blizzards came early. Brought them down; webrought them down, what aren't there yet. Or driving for Cobb's on the runup from Tamworth-Thunderbolt at the top of Hungry Hill,and I give him a wink. I wouldn't wait long, Fred,not if I was you. The troopers are just behind,coming for that job at the Hillgrove. He went like a luny, him on his big black horse. Oh, they slide and they vanishas he shuffles the years like a pack of conjuror's cards.True or not, it's all the same; and the frost on the roofcracks like a whip, and the back-log break into ash.Wake, old man. This is winter, and the yarns are over.No-one is listeningSouth of my days' circleI know it dark against the stars, the high lean countryfull of old stories that still go walking in my sleep.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHer teacher's certainty it must be MabelMade Maple first take notice of her name.She asked her father and he told her, 'Maple—Maple is right.''But teacher told the schoolThere's no such name.''Teachers don't know as muchAs fathers about children, you tell teacher.You tell her that it's M-A-P-L-E.You ask her if she knows a maple tree.Well, you were named after a maple tree.Your mother named you. You and she just sawEach other in passing in the room upstairs,One coming this way into life, and oneGoing the other out of life—you know?So you can't have much recollection of her.She had been having a long look at you.She put her finger in your cheek so hardIt must have made your dimple there, and said,'Maple.' I said it too: 'Yes, for her name.'She nodded. So we're sure there's no mistake.I don't know what she wanted it to mean,But it seems like some word she left to bid youBe a good girl—be like a maple tree.How like a maple tree's for us to guess.Or for a little girl to guess sometime.Not now—at least I shouldn't try too hard now.By and by I will tell you all I knowAbout the different trees, and something, too,About your mother that perhaps may help.'Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.Luckily all she wanted of her name thenWas to rebuke her teacher with it next day,And give the teacher a scare as from her father.Anything further had been wasted on her,Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.She would forget it. She all but forgot it.What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,And came so near death in the dark of years,That when it woke and came to life againThe flower was different from the parent seed.It carne back vaguely at the glass one day,As she stood saying her name over aloud,Striking it gently across her lowered eyesTo make it go well with the way she looked.What was it about her name? Its strangeness layIn having too much meaning. Other names,As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,But hadn't as it went. (She knew a Rose.)This difference from other names it wasMade people notice it—and notice her.(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)Her problem was to find out what it askedIn dress or manner of the girl who bore it.If she could form some notion of her mother—What she bad thought was lovely, and what good.This was her mother's childhood home;The house one story high in front, three storiesOn the end it presented to the road.(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)Her mother's bedroom was her father's still,Where she could watch her mother's picture fading.Once she found for a bookmark in the BibleA maple leaf she thought must have been laidIn wait for her there. She read every wordOf the two pages it was pressed between,As if it was her mother speaking to her.But forgot to put the leaf back in closingAnd lost the place never to read again.She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it.So she looked for herself, as everyoneLooks for himself, more or less outwardly.And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,May still have been what led her on to read,And think a little, and get some city schooling.She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand mayHave had to do with it- she sometimes wondered.So, till she found herself in a strange placeFor the name Maple to have brought her to,Taking dictation on a paper padAnd, in the pauses when she raised her eyes,Watching out of a nineteenth story windowAn airship laboring with unshiplike motionAnd a vague all-disturbing roar above the riverBeyond the highest city built with hands.Someone was saying in such natural tonesShe almost wrote the words down on her knee,'Do you know you remind me of a tree- A maple tree?''Because my name is Maple?''Isn't it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.''No doubt you've heard the office call me Mabel.I have to let them call me what they like.'They were both stirred that he should have divinedWithout the name her personal mystery.It made it seem as if there must be somethingShe must have missed herself. So they were married,And took the fancy home with them to live by.They went on pilgrimage once to her father's(The house one story high in front, three storiesOn the side it presented to the road)To see if there was not some special treeShe might have overlooked. They could find none,Not so much as a single tree for shade,Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.She told him of the bookmark maple leafIn the big Bible, and all she rememberedof the place marked with it—'Wave offering,Something about wave offering, it said.''You've never asked your father outright, have you?''I have, and been Put off sometime, I think.'(This was her faded memory of the wayOnce long ago her father had put himself off.)'Because no telling but it may have beenSomething between your father and your motherNot meant for us at all.''Not meant for me?Where would the fairness be in giving meA name to carry for life and never knowThe secret of?''And then it may have beenSomething a father couldn't tell a daughterAs well as could a mother. And againIt may have been their one lapse into fancy'Twould be too bad to make him sorry forBy bringing it up to him when be was too old.Your father feels us round him with our questing,And holds us off unnecessarily,As if he didn't know what little thingMight lead us on to a discovery.It was as personal as be could beAbout the way he saw it was with youTo say your mother, bad she lived, would beAs far again as from being born to bearing.''Just one look more with what you say in mind,And I give up'; which last look came to nothing.But though they now gave up the search forever,They clung to what one had seen in the otherBy inspiration. It proved there was something.They kept their thoughts away from when the maplesStood uniform in buckets, and the steamOf sap and snow rolled off the sugarhouse.When they made her related to the maples,It was the tree the autumn fire ran throughAnd swept of leathern leaves, but left the barkUnscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke.They always took their holidays in autumn.Once they came on a maple in a glade,Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,And every leaf of foliage she'd wornLaid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.But its age kept them from considering this one.Twenty-five years ago at Maple's namingIt hardly could have been a two-leaved seedlingThe next cow might have licked up out at pasture.Could it have been another maple like it?They hovered for a moment near discovery,Figurative enough to see the symbol,But lacking faith in anything to meanThe same at different times to different people.Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept themFrom thinking it could be a thing so bridal.And anyway it came too late for Maple.She used her hands to cover up her eyes.'We would not see the secret if we could now:We are not looking for it any more.'Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,Made a girl's marriage, and ruled in her life.No matter that the meaning was not clear.A name with meaning could bring up a child,Taking the child out of the parents' hands.Better a meaningless name, I should say,As leaving more to nature and happy chance.Name children some names and see what you do.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow as I was young and easy under the apple boughsAbout the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,The night above the dingle starry,Time let me hail and climbGolden in the heydays of his eyes,And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple townsAnd once below a time I lordly had the trees and leavesTrail with daisies and barleyDown the rivers of the windfall light.And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barnsAbout the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,In the sun that is young once only,Time let me play and beGolden in the mercy of his means,And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calvesSang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear andcold,And the sabbath rang slowlyIn the pebbles of the holy streams.All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hayFields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it wasairAnd playing, lovely and wateryAnd fire green as grass.And nightly under the simple starsAs I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, thenightjarsFlying with the ricks, and the horsesFlashing into the dark.And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer whiteWith the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was allShining, it was Adam and maiden,The sky gathered againAnd the sun grew round that very day.So it must have been after the birth of the simple lightIn the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walkingwarmOut of the whinnying green stableOn to the fields of praise.And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay houseUnder the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,In the sun born over and over,I ran my heedless ways,My wishes raced through the house high hayAnd nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allowsIn all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songsBefore the children green and goldenFollow him out of grace.Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time wouldtake meUp to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,In the moon that is always rising,Nor that riding to sleepI should hear him fly with the high fieldsAnd wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,Time held me green and dyingThough I sang in my chains like the sea.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere's a breathless hush in the Close to-night -- Ten to make and the match to win -- A bumping pitch and a blinding light, An hour to play and the last man in. And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat, Or the selfish hope of a season's fame, But his Captain's hand on his shoulder smote \"Play up! play up! and play the game!\" The sand of the desert is sodden red, -- Red with the wreck of a square that broke; -- The Gatling's jammed and the colonel dead, And the regiment blind with dust and smoke. The river of death has brimmed his banks, And England's far, and Honour a name, But the voice of schoolboy rallies the ranks, \"Play up! play up! and play the game!\" This is the word that year by year While in her place the School is set Every one of her sons must hear, And none that hears it dare forget. This they all with a joyful mind Bear through life like a torch in flame, And falling fling to the host behind -- \"Play up! play up! and play the game!\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI WHISPERED, 'I am too young,'And then, 'I am old enough';Wherefore I threw a pennyTo find out if I might love.'Go and love, go and love, young man,If the lady be young and fair.'Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,I am looped in the loops of her hair.O love is the crooked thing,There is nobody wise enoughTo find out all that is in it,For he would be thinking of loveTill the stars had run awayAnd the shadows eaten the moon.Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,One cannot begin it too soon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;   The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;   The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,   While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:       But O heart! heart! heart!         O the bleeding drops of red,           Where on the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.   O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;   Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills;      10   For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding;   For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;       Here Captain! dear father!         This arm beneath your head;           It is some dream that on the deck,             You've fallen cold and dead.   My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;   My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;   The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;   From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;      20       Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!         But I, with mournful tread,           Walk the deck my Captain lies,             Fallen cold and dead.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt so happens I am sick of being a man.And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie     housesdried up, waterproof, like a swan made of feltsteering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse     sobs.The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool.The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens,no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.It so happens that I am sick of my feet and my nailsand my hair and my shadow.It so happens I am sick of being a man.Still it would be marvelousto terrify a law clerk with a cut lily,or kill a nun with a blow on the ear.It would be greatto go through the streets with a green knifeletting out yells until I died of the cold.I don't want to go on being a root in the dark,insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,taking in and thinking, eating every day.I don't want so much misery.I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses,half frozen, dying of grief.That's why Monday, when it sees me comingwith my convict face, blazes up like gasoline,and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the     night.And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist     houses,into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.There are sulphur-colored birds, and hideous intestineshanging over the doors of houses that I hate,and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,there are mirrorsthat ought to have wept from shame and terror,there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical     cords.     I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes,my rage, forgetting everything,I walk by, going through office buildings and orthopedic     shops,and courtyards with washing hanging from the line:underwear, towels and shirts from which slowdirty tears are falling.Translated by Robert Bly\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll of the Indians must have tragic features: tragic noses, eyes, and arms.Their hands and fingers must be tragic when they reach for tragic food.The hero must be a half-breed, half white and half Indian, preferablyfrom a horse culture. He should often weep alone. That is mandatory.If the hero is an Indian woman, she is beautiful. She must be slenderand in love with a white man. But if she loves an Indian manthen he must be a half-breed, preferably from a horse culture.If the Indian woman loves a white man, then he has to be so whitethat we can see the blue veins running through his skin like rivers.When the Indian woman steps out of her dress, the white man gaspsat the endless beauty of her brown skin. She should be compared to nature: brown hills, mountains, fertile valleys, dewy grass, wind, and clear water.If she is compared to murky water, however, then she must have a secret.Indians always have secrets, which are carefully and slowly revealed.Yet Indian secrets can be disclosed suddenly, like a storm.Indian men, of course, are storms. The should destroy the livesof any white women who choose to love them. All white women loveIndian men. That is always the case. White women feign disgustat the savage in blue jeans and T-shirt, but secretly lust after him. White women dream about half-breed Indian men from horse cultures.Indian men are horses, smelling wild and gamey. When the Indian manunbuttons his pants, the white woman should think of topsoil.There must be one murder, one suicide, one attempted rape.Alcohol should be consumed. Cars must be driven at high speeds.Indians must see visions. White people can have the same visionsif they are in love with Indians. If a white person loves an Indianthen the white person is Indian by proximity. White people must carryan Indian deep inside themselves. Those interior Indians are half-breedand obviously from horse cultures. If the interior Indian is male then he must be a warrior, especially if he is inside a white man.If the interior Indian is female, then she must be a healer, especially if she is insidea white woman. Sometimes there are complications.An Indian man can be hidden inside a white woman. An Indian womancan be hidden inside a white man.  In these rare instances, everybody is a half-breed struggling to learn more about his or her horse culture.There must be redemption, of course, and sins must be forgiven.For this, we need children. A white child and an Indian child, gendernot important, should express deep affection in a childlike way.In the Great American Indian novel, when it is finally written, all of the white people will be Indians and all of the Indians will be ghosts.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt smelt of new rains and of tenderShoots of plants- and its warmth was the warmthOf earth groping for roots… even mySoul, I thought, must send its roots somewhereAnd, I loved his body without shame,On winter evenings as cold windsChuckled against the white window-panes.[From Summer in Calcutta]\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was long I layAwake that nightWishing that nightWould name the hourAnd tell me whetherTo call it day(Though not yet light)And give up sleep.The snow fell deepWith the hiss of spray;Two winds would meet,One down one street,One down another,And fight in a smotherOf dust and feather.I could not say,But feared the coldHad checked the paceOf the tower clockBy tying togetherIts hands of goldBefore its face.Then cane one knock!A note unruffledOf earthly weather,Though strange and muffled.The tower said, 'One!'And then a steeple.They spoke to themselvesAnd such few peopleAs winds might rouseFrom sleeping warm(But not unhouse).They left the stormThat struck en masseMy window glassLike a beaded fur.In that grave OneThey spoke of the sunAnd moon and stars,Saturn and MarsAnd Jupiter.Still more unfettered,They left the namedAnd spoke of the lettered,The sigmas and tausOf constellations.They filled their throatsWith the furthest bodiesTo which man sends hisSpeculation,Beyond which God is;The cosmic motesOf yawning lenses.Their solemn pealsWere not their own:They spoke for the clockWith whose vast wheelsTheirs interlock.In that grave wordUttered aloneThe utmost starTrembled and stirred,Though set so farIts whirling frenziesAppear like standingin one self station.It has not ranged,And save for the wonder Of once expandingTo be a nova,It has not changedTo the eye of manOn planets overAround and underIt in creationSince man beganTo drag down manAnd nation nation.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow can I keep my soul in me, so thatit doesn't touch your soul?

waysOf my own mind, and in the midst of tearsI hid from him, and under running laughter.Up vistaed hopes I sped and shot precipitatedAdown titanic glooms of chasme d hearsFrom those strong feet that followed, followed afterBut with unhurrying chase and unperturbe d pace,Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,They beat, and a Voice beat,More instant than the feet:All things betray thee who betrayest me.I pleaded, outlaw--wise by many a hearted casement,curtained red, trellised with inter-twining charities,For though I knew His love who followe d,Yet was I sore adread, lest having Him,I should have nought beside.But if one little casement parted wide,The gust of his approach would clash it to.Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.Across the margent of the world I fled,And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,Smiting for shelter on their clange d bars,Fretted to dulcet jars and silvern chatterThe pale ports of the moon.I said to Dawn --- be sudden, to Eve --- be soon,With thy young skiey blossoms heap me overFrom this tremendous Lover.Float thy vague veil about me lest He see.I tempted all His servitors but to findMy own betrayal in their constancy,In faith to Him, their fickleness to me,Their traitorous trueness and their loyal deceit.To all swift things for swiftness did I sue,Clung to the whistling mane of every wind,But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,The long savannahs of the blue,Or whether, thunder-driven,They clanged His chariot thwart a heaven,Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn of their feet,Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.Still with unhurrying chase and unperturbed paceDeliberate speed, majestic instancy,Came on the following feet, and a Voice above their beat:Nought shelters thee who wilt not shelter Me.I sought no more that after which I strayedIn face of Man or Maid.But still within the little childrens' eyesSeems something, something that replies,They at least are for me, surely for me.But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair,With dawning answers there,Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.Come then, ye other children, Nature'sShare with me, said I, your delicate fellowship.Let me greet you lip to lip,Let me twine with you caresses,Wantoning with our Lady Mother's vagrant tresses,Banqueting with her in her wind walled palace,Underneath her azured dai:s,Quaffing, as your taintless way is,From a chalice, lucent weeping out of the dayspring.So it was done.I in their delicate fellowship was one.Drew the bolt of Nature's secrecies,I knew all the swift importings on the wilful face of skies,I knew how the clouds arise,Spume d of the wild sea-snortings.All that's born or dies,Rose and drooped with,Made them shapers of mine own moods, or wailful, or Divine.With them joyed and was bereaven.I was heavy with the Even,when she lit her glimmering tapers round the day's dead sanctities.I laughed in the morning's eyes.I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,Heaven and I wept together,and its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine.Against the red throb of its sunset heart,I laid my own to beatAnd share commingling heat.But not by that, by that was eased my human smart.In vain my tears were wet on Heaven's grey cheek.For ah! we know what each other says,these things and I; In sound I speak,Their sound is but their stir, they speak by silences.Nature, poor step-dame, cannot slake my drouth.Let her, if she would owe meDrop yon blue-bosomed veil of skyAnd show me the breasts o' her tenderness.Never did any milk of hers once bless my thirsting mouth.Nigh and nigh draws the chase, with unperturbe d paceDeliberate speed, majestic instancy,And past those noise d feet, a Voice comes yet more fleet:Lo, nought contentst thee who content'st nought Me.Naked, I wait thy Love's uplifted stroke. My harness, piece by piece,thou'st hewn from meAnd smitten me to my knee,I am defenceless, utterly.I slept methinks, and awoke.And slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep.In the rash lustihead of my young powers,I shook the pillaring hours,and pulled my life upon me.Grimed with smears,I stand amidst the dust o' the mounded years--My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,Have puffed and burst like sunstarts on a stream.Yeah, faileth now even dream the dreamerand the lute, the lutanist.Even the linked fantasies in whose blossomy twist,I swung the Earth, a trinket at my wrist,Have yielded, cords of all too weak account,For Earth, with heavy grief so overplussed.Ah! is thy Love indeed a weed,albeit an Amaranthine weed,Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?Ah! must, Designer Infinite,Ah! must thou char the wood 'ere thou canst limn with it ?My freshness spent its wavering shower i' the dust.And now my heart is as a broken fount,Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down everFrom the dank thoughts that shiver upon the sighful branches of mymind.Such is. What is to be ?The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind ?I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds,Yet ever and anon, a trumpet soundsFrom the hid battlements of Eternity.Those shaken mists a space unsettle,Then round the half-glimpse d turrets, slowly wash again.But not 'ere Him who summonethI first have seen, enwoundWith glooming robes purpureal; Cypress crowned.His name I know, and what his trumpet saith.Whether Man's Heart or Life it be that yield thee harvest,Must thy harvest fields be dunged with rotten death ?Now of that long pursuit,Comes at hand the bruit.That Voice is round me like a bursting Sea:And is thy Earth so marred,Shattered in shard on shard?Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest me.Strange, piteous, futile thing;Wherefore should any set thee love apart?Seeing none but I makes much of Naught (He said).And human love needs human meriting ---How hast thou merited,Of all Man's clotted clay, the dingiest clot.Alack! Thou knowest notHow little worthy of any love thou art.Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,Save me, save only me?All which I took from thee, I did'st but take,Not for thy harms,But just that thou might'st seek it in my arms.All which thy childs mistake fancies as lost,I have stored for thee at Home.Rise, clasp my hand, and come.Halts by me that Footfall.Is my gloom, after all,Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly?Ah, Fondest, Blindest, Weakest,I am He whom thou seekest.Thou dravest Love from thee who dravest Me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDemocracy will not comeToday, this yearNor everThrough compromise and fear.I have as much right As the other fellow hasTo standOn my two feet And own the land.I tire so of hearing people say, Let things take their course.Tomorrow is another day.I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.FreedomIs a strong seedPlantedIn a great need.I live here, too.I want freedomJust as you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI am the pillars of the house;The keystone of the arch am I.Take me away, and roof and wallWould fall to ruin me utterly.I am the fire upon the hearth,I am the light of the good sun,I am the heat that warms the earth,Which else were colder than a stone.At me the children warm their hands;I am their light of love alive.Without me cold the hearthstone stands,Nor could the precious children thrive.I am the twist that holds togetherThe children in its sacred ring,Their knot of love, from whose close tetherNo lost child goes a-wandering.I am the house from floor to roof,I deck the walls, the board I spread;I spin the curtains, warp and woof,And shake the down to be their bed.I am their wall against all danger,Their door against the wind and snow,Thou Whom a woman laid in a manger,Take me not till the children grow!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTHAT crazed girl improvising her music.Her poetry, dancing upon the shore,Her soul in division from itselfClimbing, falling She knew not where,Hiding amid the cargo of a steamship,Her knee-cap broken, that girl I declareA beautiful lofty thing, or a thingHeroically lost, heroically found.No matter what disaster occurredShe stood in desperate music wound,Wound, wound, and she made in her triumphWhere the bales and the baskets layNo common intelligible soundBut sang, 'O sea-starved, hungry sea.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeautiful faceThat like a daisy opens its petals to the sunSo do youOpen your face to me as I turn the page.Enchanting smileAny man would be under your spell, Oh, beauty of a magazine.How many poems have been written to you? How many Dantes have written to you, Beatrice? To your obsessive illusionTo you manufacture fantasy.But today I won't make one more ClichéAnd write this poem to you.No, no more clichés.This poem is dedicated to those womenWhose beauty is in their charm, In their intelligence, In their character, Not on their fabricated looks.This poem is to you women, That like a Shahrazade wake upEveryday with a new story to tell, A story that sings for changeThat hopes for battles: Battles for the love of the united fleshBattles for passions aroused by a new dayBattle for the neglected rightsOr just battles to survive one more night.Yes, to you women in a world of painTo you, bright star in this ever-spending universeTo you, fighter of a thousand-and-one fightsTo you, friend of my heart.From now on, my head won't look down to a magazineRather, it will contemplate the nightAnd its bright stars, And so, no more clichés.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you come to me, unbidden,Beckoning meTo long-ago rooms,Where memories lie.Offering me, as to a child, an attic,Gatherings of days too few.Baubles of stolen kisses.Trinkets of borrowed loves.Trunks of secret words,I CRY.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt's all inthe sound.

Then for God's sake go and do it;    Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,    The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,    And learned to know the desert's little ways?Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,    Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its moods and changes?    Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig aquiver?    (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,    Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,    Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?    Then hearken to the Wild -- it's wanting you.Have you suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down, yet grasped at glory,    Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?\"Done things\" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,    Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders?    (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things --    Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,    They have soaked you in convention through and through;They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching --    But can't you hear the Wild? -- it's calling you.Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;    Let us journey to a lonely land I know.There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,    And the Wild is calling, calling . . . let us go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI never thought my life could beAnything but catastropheBut suddenly I begin to seeA bit of good luck for me'Cause I've got a golden ticketI've got a golden twinkle in my eyeI never had a chance to shineNever a happy song to singBut suddenly half the world is mineWhat an amazing thing'Cause I've got a golden ticketIt's ours, CharlieI've got a golden sun up in the skyI never thought I'd see the dayWhen I would face the world and sayGood morning, look at the sunI never thought that I would beSlap in the lap of luxury'Cause I'd have said it couldn't be doneBut it can be doneI never dreamed that I would climbOver the moon in ecstasyBut nevertheless, it's there that I'mShortly about to be'Cause I've got a golden ticketI've got a golden chance to make my wayAnd with a golden ticket, it's a golden dayGood morning, look at the sun'Cause I'd have said it couldn't be doneBut it can be doneI never dreamed that I would climbOver the moon in ecstasyBut nevertheless, it's there that I'mShortly about to be'Cause I've got a golden ticket'Cause I've got a golden ticketI've got a golden chance to make my wayAnd with a golden ticket, it's a golden day\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA winter garden in an alder swamp,Where conies now come out to sun and romp,As near a paradise as it can beAnd not melt snow or start a dormant tree.It lifts existence on a plane of snowOne level higher than the earth below,One level nearer heaven overhead,And last year's berries shining scarlet red.It lifts a gaunt luxuriating beastWhere he can stretch and hold his highest featOn some wild apple tree's young tender bark,What well may prove the year's high girdle mark.So near to paradise all pairing ends:Here loveless birds now flock as winter friends,Content with bud-inspecting.

It was stillon top of its hill -Now a red ear of Indian maizewas splashed on the door.Old Glory with thirteen stripes hung on a pole. The clapboardwas old-red schoolhouse red.Inside, a new landlord,a new wife, a new broom!Atlantic seaboard antique shoppewter and plundershone in each room.A new frontier!No running next doornow to phone the sherifffor his taxi to Bathand the State Liquor Store!No one saw your ghostly imaginary loverstare through the windowand tightenthe scarf at his throat.Health to the new people,health to their flag, to their oldrestored house on the hill!Everything had been swept bare,furnished, garnished and aired.Everything's changed for the best -how quivering and fierce we were,there snowbound together,simmering like waspsin our tent of books!Poor ghost, old love, speakwith your old voiceof flaming insightthat kept us awake all night.In one bed and apart,we heard the plowgroaning up hill -a red light, then a blue,as it tossed off the snowto the side of the road.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThey should not have left him there alone, Alone that is except for the cat. He was only nine, not old enough To be left alone in a basement flat, Alone, that is, except for the cat. A dog would have been a different thing, A big gruff dog with slashing jaws, But a cat with round eyes mad as gold, Plump as a cushion with tucked-in paws--- Better have left him with a fair-sized rat! But what they did was leave him with a cat. He hated that cat; he watched it sit, A buzzing machine of soft black stuff, He sat and watched and he hated it, Snug in its fur, hot blood in a muff, And its mad gold stare and the way it sat Crooning dark warmth: he loathed all that. So he took Daddy's stick and he hit the cat. Then quick as a sudden crack in glass It hissed, black flash, to a hiding place In the dust and dark beneath the couch, And he followed the grin on his new-made face, A wide-eyed, frightened snarl of a grin, And he took the stick and he thrust it in, Hard and quick in the furry dark. The black fur squealed and he felt his skin Prickle with sparks of dry delight. Then the cat again came into sight, Shot for the door that wasn't quite shut, But the boy, quick too, slammed fast the door: The cat, half-through, was cracked like a nut And the soft black thud was dumped on the floor. Then the boy was suddenly terrified And he bit his knuckles and cried and cried; But he had to do something with the dead thing there. His eyes squeezed beads of salty prayer But the wound of fear gaped wide and raw; He dared not touch the thing with his hands So he fetched a spade and shovelled it And dumped the load of heavy fur In the spidery cupboard under the stair Where it's been for years, and though it died It's grown in that cupboard and its hot low purr Grows slowly louder year by year: There'll not be a corner for the boy to hide When the cupboard swells and all sides split And the huge black cat pads out of it.Submitted by Andrew Mayers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe calm, Cool face of the riverAsked me for a kiss.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI come from haunts of coot and hern, I make a sudden sally And sparkle out among the fern, To bicker down a valley. By thirty hills I hurry down, Or slip between the ridges, By twenty thorpes, a little town, And half a hundred bridges. Till last by Philip's farm I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I chatter over stony ways, In little sharps and trebles, I bubble into eddying bays, I babble on the pebbles. With many a curve my banks I fret By many a field and fallow, And many a fairy foreland set With willow-weed and mallow. I chatter, chatter, as I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I wind about, and in and out, With here a blossom sailing, And here and there a lusty trout, And here and there a grayling, And here and there a foamy flake Upon me, as I travel With many a silvery waterbreak Above the golden gravel, And draw them all along, and flow To join the brimming river For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever. I steal by lawns and grassy plots, I slide by hazel covers; I move the sweet forget-me-nots That grow for happy lovers. I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance, Among my skimming swallows; I make the netted sunbeam dance Against my sandy shallows. I murmur under moon and stars In brambly wildernesses; I linger by my shingly bars; I loiter round my cresses; And out again I curve and flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHalf a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade! Charge for the guns!' he said: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. 'Forward, the Light Brigade!' Was there a man dismay'd ? Not tho' the soldier knew Some one had blunder'd: Their's not to make reply, Their's not to reason why, Their's but to do and die: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of Hell Rode the six hundred. Flash'd all their sabres bare, Flash'd as they turn'd in air Sabring the gunners there, Charging an army, while All the world wonder'd: Plunged in the battery-smoke Right thro' the line they broke; Cossack and Russian Reel'd from the sabre-stroke Shatter'd and sunder'd. Then they rode back, but not Not the six hundred. Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon behind them Volley'd and thunder'd; Storm'd at with shot and shell, While horse and hero fell, They that had fought so well Came thro' the jaws of Death, Back from the mouth of Hell, All that was left of them, Left of six hundred. When can their glory fade ? O the wild charge they made! All the world wonder'd. Honour the charge they made! Honour the Light Brigade, Noble six hundred!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe moment when, after many yearsof hard work and a long voyageyou stand in the centre of your room,house, half-acre, square mile, island, country,knowing at last how you got there,and say, I own this,is the same moment when the trees unloosetheir soft arms from around you,the birds take back their language,the cliffs fissure and collapse,the air moves back from you like a waveand you can't breathe.No, they whisper. You own nothing.You were a visitor, time after timeclimbing the hill, planting the flag, proclaiming.We never belonged to you.You never found us.It was always the other way round.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI saw a little elephant standing in my garden,I said 'You don't belong in here', he said 'I beg you pardon?',I said 'This place is England, what are you doing here?',He said 'Ah, then I must be lost' and then 'Oh dear, oh dear'.'I should be back in Africa, on Saranghetti's Plain','Pray, where is the nearest station where I can catch a train?'.He caught the bus to Finchley and then to Mincing lane,And over the Embankment, where he got lost, again.The police they put him in a cell, but it was far too small,So they tied him to a lampost and he slept against the wall.But as the policemen lay sleeping by the twinkling light of dawn,The lampost and the wall were there, but the elephant was gone!So if you see an elephant, in a Jumbo Jet,You can be sure that Africa's the place he's trying to get!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat's wrong with you, with us, what's happening to us? Ah our love is a harsh cord that binds us wounding us and if we want to leave our wound, to separate, it makes a new knot for us and condemns us to drain our blood and burn together. What's wrong with you? I look at you and I find nothing in you but two eyes like all eyes, a mouth lost among a thousand mouths that I have kissed, more beautiful, a body just like those that have slipped beneath my body without leaving any memory. And how empty you went through the world like a wheat-colored jar without air, without sound, without substance! I vainly sought in you depth for my arms that dig, without cease, beneath the earth: beneath your skin, beneath your eyes, nothing, beneath your double breast scarcely raised a current of crystalline order that does not know why it flows singing. Why, why, why, my love, why?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   SILENT and amazed, even when a little boy,   I remember I heard the preacher every Sunday put God in his         statements,   As contending against some being or influence.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSweet dreams form a shade,O'er my lovely infants head.Sweet dreams of pleasant streams,By happy silent moony beamsSweet sleep with soft down.Weave thy brows an infant crown.Sweet sleep Angel mild,Hover o'er my happy child.Sweet smiles in the night,Hover over my delight.Sweet smiles Mothers smiles,All the livelong night beguiles.Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,Chase not slumber from thy eyes,Sweet moans, sweeter smiles,All the dovelike moans beguiles.Sleep sleep happy child,All creation slept and smil'd.Sleep sleep, happy sleep.While o'er thee thy mother weepSweet babe in thy face,Holy image I can trace.Sweet babe once like thee.Thy maker lay and wept for meWept for me for thee for all,When he was an infant small.Thou his image ever see.Heavenly face that smiles on thee,Smiles on thee on me on all,Who became an infant small,Infant smiles are His own smiles,Heaven & earth to peace beguiles.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe rest of us watch from beyond the fenceas the woman moves with her jagged strideinto her pain as if into a slow race.We see her body in motionbut hear no sounds, or we hearsounds but no language; or we knowit is not a language we knowyet. We can see her clearlybut for her it is running in black smoke.The cluster of cells in her swellinglike porridge boiling, and bursting,like grapes, we think. Or we think ofexplosions in mud; but we know nothing.All around us the treesand the grasses light up with forgiveness,so green and at this timeof the year healthy.We would like to call somethingout to her. Some form of cheering.There is pain but no arrival at anything.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBut like lovethe archersare blindUpon the green night,the piercing saetasleave traces of warmlily.The keel of the moonbreaks through purple cloudsand their quiversfill with dew.Ay, but like lovethe archersare blind!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder the parabola of a ball, a child turning into a man, I looked into the air too long. The ball fell in my hand, it sang in the closed fist: Open Open Behold a gift designed to kill. Now in my dial of glass appears the soldier who is going to die. He smiles, and moves about in ways his mother knows, habits of his. The wires touch his face: I cry NOW. Death, like a familiar, hears And look, has made a man of dust of a man of flesh. This sorcery I do. Being damned, I am amused to see the centre of love diffused and the wave of love travel into vacancy. How easy it is to make a ghost. The weightless mosquito touches her tiny shadow on the stone, and with how like, how infinite a lightness, man and shadow meet. They fuse. A shadow is a man when the mosquito death approaches\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBright star, would I were steadfast as thou art! - Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,And watching, with eternal lids apart,Like Nature's patient sleepless Eremite,The moving waters at their priestlike taskOf pure ablution round earth's human shores,Or gazing on the new soft fallen maskOf snow upon the mountains and the moors - No -yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,Pillowed upon my fair love's ripening breast,To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,And so live ever -or else swoon to death.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout the size of an old-style dollar bill,American or Canadian,mostly the same whites, gray greens, and steel grays-this little painting (a sketch for a larger one?)has never earned any money in its life.Useless and free., it has spent seventy yearsas a minor family relic handed along collaterally to ownerswho looked at it sometimes, or didn't bother to.It must be Nova Scotia; only theredoes one see abled wooden housespainted that awful shade of brown.The other houses, the bits that show, are white.Elm trees., low hills, a thin church steeple-that gray-blue wisp-or is it?

There it is,titanium white, one dab. The hint of steeple,filaments of brush-hairs, barely there,must be the Presbyterian church.Would that be Miss Gillespie's house?Those particular geese and cowsare naturally before my time.A sketch done in an hour, \"in one breath,\"once taken from a trunk and handed over.Would you like this?

It is an ancient Mariner,     And he stoppeth one of three.     `By thy long beard and glittering eye,     Now wherefore stopp'st thou me ?     The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,     And I am next of kin ;     The guests are met, the feast is set :     May'st hear the merry din.'     He holds him with his skinny hand,     `There was a ship,' quoth he.     `Hold off ! unhand me, grey-beard loon !'     Eftsoons his hand dropt he.The Wedding-Guest is spell-bound by the eye of the old seafaring man, andconstrained to hear his tale.     He holds him with his glittering eye--     The Wedding-Guest stood still,     And listens like a three years' child :     The Mariner hath his will.     The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone :     He cannot choose but hear ;     And thus spake on that ancient man,     The bright-eyed Mariner.     `The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,     Merrily did we drop     Below the kirk, below the hill,     Below the lighthouse top.The Mariner tells how the ship sailed southward with a good wind and fairweather, till it reached the Line.     The Sun came up upon the left,     Out of the sea came he !     And he shone bright, and on the right     Went down into the sea.     Higher and higher every day,     Till over the mast at noon--'     The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,     For he heard the loud bassoon.The Wedding-Guest heareth the bridal music ; but the Mariner continueth histale.     The bride hath paced into the hall,     Red as a rose is she ;     Nodding their heads before her goes     The merry minstrelsy.     The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,     Yet he cannot choose but hear ;     And thus spake on that ancient man,     The bright-eyed Mariner.The ship driven by a storm toward the south pole.     `And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he     Was tyrannous and strong :     He struck with his o'ertaking wings,     And chased us south along.     With sloping masts and dipping prow,     As who pursued with yell and blow     Still treads the shadow of his foe,     And forward bends his head,     The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,     The southward aye we fled.     And now there came both mist and snow,     And it grew wondrous cold :     And ice, mast-high, came floating by,     As green as emerald.The land of ice, and of fearful sounds where no living thing was to beseen.     And through the drifts the snowy clifts     Did send a dismal sheen :     Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--     The ice was all between.     The ice was here, the ice was there,     The ice was all around :     It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,     Like noises in a swound !Till a great sea-bird, called the Albatross, came through the snow-fog, andwas received with great joy and hospitality.     At length did cross an Albatross,     Thorough the fog it came ;     As if it had been a Christian soul,     We hailed it in God's name.     It ate the food it ne'er had eat,     And round and round it flew.     The ice did split with a thunder-fit ;     The helmsman steered us through !And lo ! the Albatross proveth a bird of good omen, and followeth the shipas it returned northward through fog and floating ice.     And a good south wind sprung up behind ;     The Albatross did follow,     And every day, for food or play,     Came to the mariner's hollo !     In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,     It perched for vespers nine ;     Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,     Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'The ancient Mariner inhospitably killeth the pious bird of good omen.     `God save thee, ancient Mariner !     From the fiends, that plague thee thus !--     Why look'st thou so ?'--With my cross-bow     I shot the ALBATROSS.PART II     The Sun now rose upon the right :     Out of the sea came he,     Still hid in mist, and on the left     Went down into the sea.     And the good south wind still blew behind,     But no sweet bird did follow,     Nor any day for food or play     Came to the mariners' hollo !His shipmates cry out against the ancient Mariner, for killing the bird ofgood luck.     And I had done an hellish thing,     And it would work 'em woe :     For all averred, I had killed the bird     That made the breeze to blow.     Ah wretch ! said they, the bird to slay,     That made the breeze to blow !But when the fog cleared off, they justify the same, and thus makethemselves accomplices in the crime.     Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,     The glorious Sun uprist :     Then all averred, I had killed the bird     That brought the fog and mist.     'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,     That bring the fog and mist.The fair breeze continues ; the ship enters the Pacific Ocean, and sailsnorthward, even till it reaches the Line.     The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,     The furrow followed free ;     We were the first that ever burst     Into that silent sea.The ship hath been suddenly becalmed.     Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,     'Twas sad as sad could be ;     And we did speak only to break     The silence of the sea !     All in a hot and copper sky,     The bloody Sun, at noon,     Right up above the mast did stand,     No bigger than the Moon.     Day after day, day after day,     We stuck, nor breath nor motion ;     As idle as a painted ship     Upon a painted ocean.And the Albatross begins to be avenged.     Water, water, every where,     And all the boards did shrink ;     Water, water, every where,     Nor any drop to drink.     The very deep did rot : O Christ !     That ever this should be !     Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs     Upon the slimy sea.     About, about, in reel and rout     The death-fires danced at night ;     The water, like a witch's oils,     Burnt green, and blue and white.A Spirit had followed them ; one of the invisible inhabitants of thisplanet, neither departed souls nor angels ; concerning whom the learnedJew, Josephus, and the Platonic Constantinopolitan, Michael Psellus, may beconsulted. They are very numerous, and there is no climate or elementwithout one or more.     And some in dreams assuréd were     Of the Spirit that plagued us so ;     Nine fathom deep he had followed us     From the land of mist and snow.     And every tongue, through utter drought,     Was withered at the root ;     We could not speak, no more than if     We had been choked with soot.The shipmates, in their sore distress, would fain throw the whole guilt onthe ancient Mariner : in sign whereof they hang the dead sea-bird round hisneck.     Ah ! well a-day ! what evil looks     Had I from old and young !     Instead of the cross, the Albatross     About my neck was hung.PART III     There passed a weary time. Each throat     Was parched, and glazed each eye.     A weary time ! a weary time !     How glazed each weary eye,     When looking westward, I beheld     A something in the sky.The ancient Mariner beholdeth a sign in the element afar off.     At first it seemed a little speck,     And then it seemed a mist ;     It moved and moved, and took at last     A certain shape, I wist.     A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist !     And still it neared and neared :     As if it dodged a water-sprite,     It plunged and tacked and veered.At its nearer approach, it seemeth him to be a ship ; and at a dear ransomhe freeth his speech from the bonds of thirst.     With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,     We could nor laugh nor wail ;     Through utter drought all dumb we stood !     I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,     And cried, A sail ! a sail !A flash of joy ;     With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,     Agape they heard me call :     Gramercy ! they for joy did grin,     And all at once their breath drew in,     As they were drinking all.And horror follows. For can it be a ship that comes onward without wind ortide ?     See ! see ! (I cried) she tacks no more !     Hither to work us weal ;     Without a breeze, without a tide,     She steadies with upright keel !     The western wave was all a-flame.     The day was well nigh done !     Almost upon the western wave     Rested the broad bright Sun ;     When that strange shape drove suddenly     Betwixt us and the Sun.It seemeth him but the skeleton of a ship.     And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,     (Heaven's Mother send us grace !)     As if through a dungeon-grate he peered     With broad and burning face.And its ribs are seen as bars on the face of the setting Sun.     Alas ! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)     How fast she nears and nears !     Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,     Like restless gossameres ?The Spectre-Woman and her Death-mate, and no other on board the skeletonship.     And those her ribs through which the Sun     Did peer, as through a grate ?     And is that Woman all her crew ?     Is that a DEATH ? and are there two ?     Is DEATH that woman's mate ?[first version of this stanza through the end of Part III]Like vessel, like crew !     Her lips were red, her looks were free,     Her locks were yellow as gold :     Her skin was as white as leprosy,     The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,     Who thicks man's blood with cold.Death and Life-in-Death have diced for the ship's crew, and she (thelatter) winneth the ancient Mariner.     The naked hulk alongside came,     And the twain were casting dice ;     `The game is done ! I've won ! I've won !'     Quoth she, and whistles thrice.No twilight within the courts of the Sun.     The Sun's rim dips ; the stars rush out :     At one stride comes the dark ;     With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,     Off shot the spectre-bark.At the rising of the Moon,     We listened and looked sideways up !     Fear at my heart, as at a cup,     My life-blood seemed to sip !     The stars were dim, and thick the night,     The steerman's face by his lamp gleamed white ;     From the sails the dew did drip--     Till clomb above the eastern bar     The hornéd Moon, with one bright star     Within the nether tip.One after another,     One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,     Too quick for groan or sigh,     Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,     And cursed me with his eye.His shipmates drop down dead.     Four times fifty living men,     (And I heard nor sigh nor groan)     With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,     They dropped down one by one.But Life-in-Death begins her work on the ancient Mariner.     The souls did from their bodies fly,--     They fled to bliss or woe !     And every soul, it passed me by,     Like the whizz of my cross-bow !PART IVThe Wedding-Guest feareth that a Spirit is talking to him ;     `I fear thee, ancient Mariner !     I fear thy skinny hand !     And thou art long, and lank, and brown,     As is the ribbed sea-sand.(Coleridge's note on above stanza)     I fear thee and thy glittering eye,     And thy skinny hand, so brown.'--     Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest !     This body dropt not down.But the ancient Mariner assureth him of his bodily life, and proceedeth torelate his horrible penance.     Alone, alone, all, all alone,     Alone on a wide wide sea !     And never a saint took pity on     My soul in agony.He despiseth the creatures of the calm,     The many men, so beautiful !     And they all dead did lie :     And a thousand thousand slimy things     Lived on ; and so did I.And envieth that they should live, and so many lie dead.     I looked upon the rotting sea,     And drew my eyes away ;     I looked upon the rotting deck,     And there the dead men lay.     I looked to heaven, and tried to pray ;     But or ever a prayer had gusht,     A wicked whisper came, and made     My heart as dry as dust.     I closed my lids, and kept them close,     And the balls like pulses beat ;     For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky     Lay like a load on my weary eye,     And the dead were at my feet.But the curse liveth for him in the eye of the dead men.     The cold sweat melted from their limbs,     Nor rot nor reek did they :     The look with which they looked on me     Had never passed away.     An orphan's curse would drag to hell     A spirit from on high ;     But oh ! more horrible than that     Is the curse in a dead man's eye !     Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,     And yet I could not die.In his loneliness and fixedness he yearneth towards the journeying Moon,and the stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward ; and every wherethe blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest, and their nativecountry and their own natural homes, which they enter unannounced, as lordsthat are certainly expected and yet there is a silent joy at their arrival.     The moving Moon went up the sky,     And no where did abide :     Softly she was going up,     And a star or two beside--     Her beams bemocked the sultry main,     Like April hoar-frost spread ;     But where the ship's huge shadow lay,     The charméd water burnt alway     A still and awful red.By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God's creatures of the great calm.     Beyond the shadow of the ship,     I watched the water-snakes :     They moved in tracks of shining white,     And when they reared, the elfish light     Fell off in hoary flakes.     Within the shadow of the ship     I watched their rich attire :     Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,     They coiled and swam ; and every track     Was a flash of golden fire.Their beauty and their happiness.He blesseth them in his heart.     O happy living things ! no tongue     Their beauty might declare :     A spring of love gushed from my heart,     And I blessed them unaware :     Sure my kind saint took pity on me,     And I blessed them unaware.The spell begins to break.     The self-same moment I could pray ;     And from my neck so free     The Albatross fell off, and sank     Like lead into the sea.PART V     Oh sleep ! it is a gentle thing,     Beloved from pole to pole !     To Mary Queen the praise be given !     She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,     That slid into my soul.By grace of the holy Mother, the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain.     The silly buckets on the deck,     That had so long remained,     I dreamt that they were filled with dew ;     And when I awoke, it rained.     My lips were wet, my throat was cold,     My garments all were dank ;     Sure I had drunken in my dreams,     And still my body drank.     I moved, and could not feel my limbs :     I was so light--almost     I thought that I had died in sleep,     And was a blesséd ghost.He heareth sounds and seeth strange sights and commotions in the sky andthe element.     And soon I heard a roaring wind :     It did not come anear ;     But with its sound it shook the sails,     That were so thin and sere.     The upper air burst into life !     And a hundred fire-flags sheen,     To and fro they were hurried about !     And to and fro, and in and out,     The wan stars danced between.     And the coming wind did roar more loud,     And the sails did sigh like sedge ;     And the rain poured down from one black cloud ;     The Moon was at its edge.     The thick black cloud was cleft, and still     The Moon was at its side :     Like waters shot from some high crag,     The lightning fell with never a jag,     A river steep and wide.The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired, and the ship moves on ;     The loud wind never reached the ship,     Yet now the ship moved on !     Beneath the lightning and the Moon     The dead men gave a groan.     They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,     Nor spake, nor moved their eyes ;     It had been strange, even in a dream,     To have seen those dead men rise.     The helmsman steered, the ship moved on ;     Yet never a breeze up-blew ;     The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,     Where they were wont to do ;     They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--     We were a ghastly crew.     The body of my brother's son     Stood by me, knee to knee :     The body and I pulled at one rope,     But he said nought to me.But not by the souls of the men, nor by dæmons of earth or middle air, butby a blessed troop of angelic spirits, sent down by the invocation of theguardian saint.     `I fear thee, ancient Mariner !'     Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest !     'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,     Which to their corses came again,     But a troop of spirits blest :     For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,     And clustered round the mast ;     Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,     And from their bodies passed.     Around, around, flew each sweet sound,     Then darted to the Sun ;     Slowly the sounds came back again,     Now mixed, now one by one.     Sometimes a-dropping from the sky     I heard the sky-lark sing ;     Sometimes all little birds that are,     How they seemed to fill the sea and air     With their sweet jargoning !     And now 'twas like all instruments,     Now like a lonely flute ;     And now it is an angel's song,     That makes the heavens be mute.     It ceased ; yet still the sails made on     A pleasant noise till noon,     A noise like of a hidden brook     In the leafy month of June,     That to the sleeping woods all night     Singeth a quiet tune.[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.]     Till noon we quietly sailed on,     Yet never a breeze did breathe :     Slowly and smoothly went the ship,     Moved onward from beneath.The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship as far as theLine, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still requireth vengeance.     Under the keel nine fathom deep,     From the land of mist and snow,     The spirit slid : and it was he     That made the ship to go.     The sails at noon left off their tune,     And the ship stood still also.     The Sun, right up above the mast,     Had fixed her to the ocean :     But in a minute she 'gan stir,     With a short uneasy motion--     Backwards and forwards half her length     With a short uneasy motion.     Then like a pawing horse let go,     She made a sudden bound :     It flung the blood into my head,     And I fell down in a swound.The Polar Spirit's fellow-dæmons, the invisible inhabitants of the element,take part in his wrong ; and two of them relate, one to the other, thatpenance long and heavy for the ancient Mariner hath been accorded to thePolar Spirit, who returneth southward.     How long in that same fit I lay,     I have not to declare ;     But ere my living life returned,     I heard and in my soul discerned     Two voices in the air.     `Is it he ?' quoth one, `Is this the man ?     By him who died on cross,     With his cruel bow he laid full low     The harmless Albatross.     The spirit who bideth by himself     In the land of mist and snow,     He loved the bird that loved the man     Who shot him with his bow.'     The other was a softer voice,     As soft as honey-dew :     Quoth he, `The man hath penance done,     And penance more will do.'PART VI     FIRST VOICE     `But tell me, tell me ! speak again,     Thy soft response renewing--     What makes that ship drive on so fast ?     What is the ocean doing ?'     SECOND VOICE     `Still as a slave before his lord,     The ocean hath no blast ;     His great bright eye most silently     Up to the Moon is cast--     If he may know which way to go ;     For she guides him smooth or grim.     See, brother, see ! how graciously     She looketh down on him.'The Mariner hath been cast into a trance ; for the angelic power causeththe vessel to drive northward faster than human life could endure.     FIRST VOICE     `But why drives on that ship so fast,     Without or wave or wind ?'     SECOND VOICE     `The air is cut away before,     And closes from behind.     Fly, brother, fly ! more high, more high !     Or we shall be belated :     For slow and slow that ship will go,     When the Mariner's trance is abated.'The supernatural motion is retarded ; the Mariner awakes, and his penancebegins anew.     I woke, and we were sailing on     As in a gentle weather :     'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high ;     The dead men stood together.     All stood together on the deck,     For a charnel-dungeon fitter :     All fixed on me their stony eyes,     That in the Moon did glitter.     The pang, the curse, with which they died,     Had never passed away :     I could not draw my eyes from theirs,     Nor turn them up to pray.The curse is finally expiated.     And now this spell was snapt : once more     I viewed the ocean green,     And looked far forth, yet little saw     Of what had else been seen--     Like one, that on a lonesome road     Doth walk in fear and dread,     And having once turned round walks on,     And turns no more his head ;     Because he knows, a frightful fiend     Doth close behind him tread.     But soon there breathed a wind on me,     Nor sound nor motion made :     Its path was not upon the sea,     In ripple or in shade.     It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek     Like a meadow-gale of spring--     It mingled strangely with my fears,     Yet it felt like a welcoming.     Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,     Yet she sailed softly too :     Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--     On me alone it blew.And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.     Oh ! dream of joy ! is this indeed     The light-house top I see ?     Is this the hill ? is this the kirk ?     Is this mine own countree ?     We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,     And I with sobs did pray--     O let me be awake, my God !     Or let me sleep alway.     The harbour-bay was clear as glass,     So smoothly it was strewn !     And on the bay the moonlight lay,     And the shadow of the Moon.[Additional stanzas, dropped after the first edition.]     The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,     That stands above the rock :     The moonlight steeped in silentness     The steady weathercock.The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,     And the bay was white with silent light,     Till rising from the same,     Full many shapes, that shadows were,     In crimson colours came.And appear in their own forms of light.     A little distance from the prow     Those crimson shadows were :     I turned my eyes upon the deck--     Oh, Christ ! what saw I there !     Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,     And, by the holy rood !     A man all light, a seraph-man,     On every corse there stood.     This seraph-band, each waved his hand :     It was a heavenly sight !     They stood as signals to the land,     Each one a lovely light ;     This seraph-band, each waved his hand,     No voice did they impart--     No voice ; but oh ! the silence sank     Like music on my heart.     But soon I heard the dash of oars,     I heard the Pilot's cheer ;     My head was turned perforce away     And I saw a boat appear.[Additional stanza, dropped after the first edition.]     The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,     I heard them coming fast :     Dear Lord in Heaven ! it was a joy     The dead men could not blast.     I saw a third--I heard his voice :     It is the Hermit good !     He singeth loud his godly hymns     That he makes in the wood.     He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away     The Albatross's blood.PART VIIThe Hermit of the Wood,     This Hermit good lives in that wood     Which slopes down to the sea.     How loudly his sweet voice he rears !     He loves to talk with marineres     That come from a far countree.     He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--     He hath a cushion plump :     It is the moss that wholly hides     The rotted old oak-stump.     The skiff-boat neared : I heard them talk,     `Why, this is strange, I trow !     Where are those lights so many and fair,     That signal made but now ?'Approacheth the ship with wonder.     `Strange, by my faith !' the Hermit said--     `And they answered not our cheer !     The planks looked warped ! and see those sails,     How thin they are and sere !     I never saw aught like to them,     Unless perchance it were     Brown skeletons of leaves that lag     My forest-brook along ;     When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,     And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,     That eats the she-wolf's young.'     `Dear Lord ! it hath a fiendish look--     (The Pilot made reply)     I am a-feared'--`Push on, push on !'     Said the Hermit cheerily.     The boat came closer to the ship,     But I nor spake nor stirred ;     The boat came close beneath the ship,     And straight a sound was heard.The ship suddenly sinketh.     Under the water it rumbled on,     Still louder and more dread :     It reached the ship, it split the bay ;     The ship went down like lead.The ancient Mariner is saved in the Pilot's boat.     Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,     Which sky and ocean smote,     Like one that hath been seven days drowned     My body lay afloat ;     But swift as dreams, myself I found     Within the Pilot's boat.     Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,     The boat spun round and round ;     And all was still, save that the hill     Was telling of the sound.     I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked     And fell down in a fit ;     The holy Hermit raised his eyes,     And prayed where he did sit.     I took the oars : the Pilot's boy,     Who now doth crazy go,     Laughed loud and long, and all the while     His eyes went to and fro.     `Ha ! ha !' quoth he, `full plain I see,     The Devil knows how to row.'     And now, all in my own countree,     I stood on the firm land !     The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,     And scarcely he could stand.The ancient Mariner earnestly entreateth the Hermit to shrieve him ; andthe penance of life falls on him.     `O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man !'     The Hermit crossed his brow.     `Say quick,' quoth he, `I bid thee say--     What manner of man art thou ?'     Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched     With a woful agony,     Which forced me to begin my tale ;     And then it left me free.And ever and anon through out his future life an agony constraineth him totravel from land to land ;     Since then, at an uncertain hour,     That agony returns :     And till my ghastly tale is told,     This heart within me burns.     I pass, like night, from land to land ;     I have strange power of speech ;     That moment that his face I see,     I know the man that must hear me :     To him my tale I teach.     What loud uproar bursts from that door !     The wedding-guests are there :     But in the garden-bower the bride     And bride-maids singing are :     And hark the little vesper bell,     Which biddeth me to prayer !     O Wedding-Guest ! this soul hath been     Alone on a wide wide sea :     So lonely 'twas, that God himself     Scarce seeméd there to be.     O sweeter than the marriage-feast,     'Tis sweeter far to me,     To walk together to the kirk     With a goodly company !--     To walk together to the kirk,     And all together pray,     While each to his great Father bends,     Old men, and babes, and loving friends     And youths and maidens gay !And to teach, by his own example, love and reverence to all things that Godmade and loveth.     Farewell, farewell ! but this I tell     To thee, thou Wedding-Guest !     He prayeth well, who loveth well     Both man and bird and beast.     He prayeth best, who loveth best     All things both great and small ;     For the dear God who loveth us,     He made and loveth all.     The Mariner, whose eye is bright,     Whose beard with age is hoar,     Is gone : and now the Wedding-Guest     Turned from the bridegroom's door.     He went like one that hath been stunned,     And is of sense forlorn :     A sadder and a wiser man,     He rose the morrow morn.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWho wants my jellyfish?I'm not sellyfish!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy son aged three fell in the nettle bed.'Bed' seemed a curious name for those green spears,That regiment of spite behind the shed:It was no place for rest.  With sobs and tearsThe boy came seeking comfort and I sawWhite blisters beaded on his tender skin.We soothed him till his pain was not so raw.At last he offered us a watery grin,And then I took my billhook, honed the bladeAnd went outside and slashed in fury with itTill not a nettle in that fierce paradeStood upright any more.  And then I litA funeral pyre to burn the fallen dead,But in two weeks the busy sun and rainHad called up tall recruits behind the shed:My son would often feel sharp wounds again.Submitted by Andrew Mayers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf all the griefs I am to haveWould only come today,I am so happy I believeThey'd laugh and run away.If all the joys I am to haveWould only come today,They could not be so big as thisThat happens to me now.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe sea is calm to-night.The tide is full, the moon lies fairUpon the straits; - on the French coast the lightGleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.Come to the window, sweet is the night-air! Only, from the long line of sprayWhere the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,Listen! you hear the grating roarOf pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,At their return, up the high strand,Begin, and cease, and then again begin,With tremulous cadence slow, and bringThe eternal note of sadness in.Sophocles long agoHeard it on the {AE}gean, and it broughtInto his mind the turbid ebb and flowOf human misery; weFind also in the sound a thought,Hearing it by this distant northern sea.The Sea of FaithWas once, too, at the full, and round earth's shoreLay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.But now I only hearIts melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,Retreating, to the breathOf the night-wind, down the vast edges drearAnd naked shingles of the world.Ah, love, let us be trueTo one another! for the world, which seemsTo lie before us like a land of dreams,So various, so beautiful, so new,Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain; And we are here as on a darkling plainSwept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,Where ignorant armies clash by night.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGive me your patience, sister, while I frameExact in capitals your golden name;Or sue the fair Apollo and he willRouse from his heavy slumber and instillGreat love in me for thee and Poesy.Imagine not that greatest masteryAnd kingdom over all the Realms of verse,Nears more to heaven in aught, than when we nurseAnd surety give to love and Brotherhood.Anthropophagi in Othello's mood;Ulysses storm'd and his enchanted belt Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt Unbosom'd so and so eternal made, Such tender incense in their laurel shadeTo all the regent sisters of the NineAs this poor offering to you, sister mine.Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are;Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where;And may it taste to you like good old wine,Take you to real happiness and giveSons, daughters and a home like honied hive.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI saw a little elephant standing in my garden,I said 'You don't belong in here', he said 'I beg you pardon?',I said 'This place is England, what are you doing here?',He said 'Ah, then I must be lost' and then 'Oh dear, oh dear'.'I should be back in Africa, on Saranghetti's Plain','Pray, where is the nearest station where I can catch a train?'.He caught the bus to Finchley and then to Mincing lane,And over the Embankment, where he got lost, again.The police they put him in a cell, but it was far too small,So they tied him to a lampost and he slept against the wall.But as the policemen lay sleeping by the twinkling light of dawn,The lampost and the wall were there, but the elephant was gone!So if you see an elephant, in a Jumbo Jet,You can be sure that Africa's the place he's trying to get!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn places likeSelma, Alabama,Kids say,In places likeChicago and New York...In places like Chicago and New YorkKids say,In places likeLondon and Paris...In places likeLondon and ParisKids say,In places like Chicago and New York...\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a word we use to plugholes with.

The moon, like a flower,     In heaven's high bower,     With silent delight     Sits and smiles on the night.Farewell, green fields and happy groves,Where flocks have took delight.Where lambs have nibbled, silent movesThe feet of angels bright;     Unseen they pour blessing,     And joy without ceasing,     On each bud and blossom,     And each sleeping bosom.They look in every thoughtless nest,Where birds are covered warm;They visit caves of every beast,To keep them all from harm.     If they see any weeping     That should have been sleeping,     They pour sleep on their head,     And sit down by their bed.When wolves and tigers howl for prey,They pitying stand and weep;Seeking to drive their thirst away,And keep them from the sheep.     But if they rush dreadful,     The angels, most heedful,     Receive each mild spirit,     New worlds to inherit.And there the lion's ruddy eyesShall flow with tears of gold,And pitying the tender cries,And walking round the fold,     Saying, 'Wrath, by His meekness,     And, by His health, sickness     Is driven away     From our immortal day.'And now beside thee, bleating lamb,I can lie down and sleep;Or think on Him who bore thy name,Graze after thee and weep.     For, washed in life's river,     My bright mane for ever     Shall shine like the gold     As I guard o'er the fold.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Tis eight o'clock,--a clear March night, The moon is up,--the sky is blue, The owlet, in the moonlight air, Shouts from nobody knows where; He lengthens out his lonely shout, Halloo! halloo! a long halloo! --Why bustle thus about your door, What means this bustle, Betty Foy? Why are you in this mighty fret? And why on horseback have you set Him whom you love, your Idiot Boy? Scarcely a soul is out of bed; Good Betty, put him down again; His lips with joy they burr at you; But, Betty! what has he to do With stirrup, saddle, or with rein? But Betty's bent on her intent; For her good neighbour, Susan Gale, Old Susan, she who dwells alone, Is sick, and makes a piteous moan As if her very life would fail. There's not a house within a mile, No hand to help them in distress; Old Susan lies a-bed in pain, And sorely puzzled are the twain, For what she ails they cannot guess. And Betty's husband's at the wood, Where by the week he doth abide, A woodman in the distant vale; There's none to help poor Susan Gale; What must be done? what will betide? And Betty from the lane has fetched Her Pony, that is mild and good; Whether he be in joy or pain, Feeding at will along the lane, Or bringing faggots from the wood. And he is all in travelling trim,-- And, by the moonlight, Betty Foy Has on the well-girt saddle set (The like was never heard of yet) Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. And he must post without delay Across the bridge and through the dale, And by the church, and o'er the down, To bring a Doctor from the town, Or she will die, old Susan Gale. There is no need of boot or spur, There is no need of whip or wand; For Johnny has his holly-bough, And with a 'hurly-burly' now He shakes the green bough in his hand. And Betty o'er and o'er has told The Boy, who is her best delight, Both what to follow, what to shun, What do, and what to leave undone, How turn to left, and how to right. And Betty's most especial charge, Was, 'Johnny! Johnny! mind that you Come home again, nor stop at all,-- Come home again, whate'er befall, My Johnny, do, I pray you do.' To this did Johnny answer make, Both with his head and with his hand, And proudly shook the bridle too; And then! his words were not a few, Which Betty well could understand. And now that Johnny is just going, Though Betty's in a mighty flurry, She gently pats the Pony's side, On which her Idiot Boy must ride, And seems no longer in a hurry. But when the Pony moved his legs, Oh! then for the poor Idiot Boy! For joy he cannot hold the bridle, For joy his head and heels are idle, He's idle all for very joy. And while the Pony moves his legs, In Johnny's left hand you may see The green bough motionless and dead: The Moon that shines above his head Is not more still and mute than he. His heart it was so full of glee, That till full fifty yards were gone, He quite forgot his holly whip, And all his skill in horsemanship: Oh! happy, happy, happy John. And while the Mother, at the door, Stands fixed, her face with joy o'erflows, Proud of herself, and proud of him, She sees him in his travelling trim, How quietly her Johnny goes. The silence of her Idiot Boy, What hopes it sends to Betty's heart! He's at the guide-post--he turns right; She watches till he's out of sight, And Betty will not then depart. Burr, burr--now Johnny's lips they burr, As loud as any mill, or near it; Meek as a lamb the Pony moves, And Johnny makes the noise he loves, 0 And Betty listens, glad to hear it. Away she hies to Susan Gale: Her Messenger's in merry tune; The owlets hoot, the owlets curr, And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr, As on he goes beneath the moon. His steed and he right well agree; For of this Pony there's a rumour, That, should he lose his eyes and ears, And should he live a thousand years, He never will be out of humour. But then he is a horse that thinks! And when he thinks, his pace is slack; Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, Yet, for his life, he cannot tell What he has got upon his back. So through the moonlight lanes they go, And far into the moonlight dale, And by the church, and o'er the down, To bring a Doctor from the town, To comfort poor old Susan Gale. And Betty, now at Susan's side, Is in the middle of her story, What speedy help her Boy will bring, With many a most diverting thing, Of Johnny's wit, and Johnny's glory. And Betty, still at Susan's side, By this time is not quite so flurried: Demure with porringer and plate She sits, as if in Susan's fate Her life and soul were buried. But Betty, poor good woman! she, You plainly in her face may read it, Could lend out of that moment's store Five years of happiness or more To any that might need it. But yet I guess that now and then With Betty all was not so well; And to the road she turns her ears, And thence full many a sound she hears, Which she to Susan will not tell. Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans; 'As sure as there's a moon in heaven,' Cries Betty, 'he'll be back again; They'll both be here--'tis almost ten-- Both will be here before eleven.' Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans; The clock gives warning for eleven; 'Tis on the stroke--'He must be near,' Quoth Betty, 'and will soon be here, As sure as there's a moon in heaven.' The clock is on the stroke of twelve, And Johnny is not yet in sight: --The Moon's in heaven, as Betty sees, But Betty is not quite at ease; And Susan has a dreadful night. And Betty, half an hour ago, On Johnny vile reflections cast: 'A little idle sauntering Thing!' With other names, an endless string; But now that time is gone and past. And Betty's drooping at the heart, That happy time all past and gone, 'How can it be he is so late? The Doctor, he has made him wait; Susan! they'll both be here anon.' And Susan's growing worse and worse, And Betty's in a sad 'quandary'; And then there's nobody to say If she must go, or she must stay! --She's in a sad 'quandary'. The clock is on the stroke of one; But neither Doctor nor his Guide Appears along the moonlight road; There's neither horse nor man abroad, And Betty's still at Susan's side. And Susan now begins to fear Of sad mischances not a few, That Johnny may perhaps be drowned; Or lost, perhaps, and never found; Which they must both for ever rue. She prefaced half a hint of this With, 'God forbid it should be true!' At the first word that Susan said Cried Betty, rising from the bed, 'Susan, I'd gladly stay with you. 'I must be gone, I must away: Consider, Johnny's but half-wise; Susan, we must take care of him, If he is hurt in life or limb'-- 'Oh God forbid!' poor Susan cries. 'What can I do?' says Betty, going, 'What can I do to ease your pain? Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay; I fear you're in a dreadful way, But I shall soon be back again.' 'Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go! There's nothing that can ease my pain,' Then off she hies, but with a prayer That God poor Susan's life would spare, 0 Till she comes back again. So, through the moonlight lane she goes, And far into the moonlight dale; And how she ran, and how she walked, And all that to herself she talked, Would surely be a tedious tale. In high and low, above, below, In great and small, in round and square, In tree and tower was Johnny seen, In bush and brake, in black and green; 'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where. And while she crossed the bridge, there came A thought with which her heart is sore-- Johnny perhaps his horse forsook, To hunt the moon within the brook, And never will be heard of more. Now is she high upon the down, Alone amid a prospect wide; There's neither Johnny nor his Horse Among the fern or in the gorse; There's neither Doctor nor his Guide. 'O saints! what is become of him? Perhaps he's climbed into an oak, Where he will stay till he is dead; Or, sadly he has been misled, And joined the wandering gipsy-folk. 'Or him that wicked Pony's carried To the dark cave, the goblin's hall; Or in the castle he's pursuing Among the ghosts his own undoing; Or playing with the waterfall.' At poor old Susan then she railed, While to the town she posts away; 'If Susan had not been so ill, Alas! I should have had him still, My Johnny, till my dying day.' Poor Betty, in this sad distemper, The Doctor's self could hardly spare: Unworthy things she talked, and wild; Even he, of cattle the most mild, The Pony had his share. But now she's fairly in the town, And to the Doctor's door she hies; 'Tis silence all on every side; The town so long, the town so wide, Is silent as the skies. And now she's at the Doctor's door, She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap; The Doctor at the casement shows His glimmering eyes that peep and doze! And one hand rubs his old night-cap. 'O Doctor! Doctor! where's my Johnny?' 'I'm here, what is't you want with me?' 'O Sir! you know I'm Betty Foy, And I have lost my poor dear Boy, You know him--him you often see; 'He's not so wise as some folks be:' 'The devil take his wisdom!' said The Doctor, looking somewhat grim, 'What, Woman! should I know of him?' And, grumbling, he went back to bed! 'O woe is me! O woe is me! Here will I die, here will I die; I thought to find my lost one here, But he is neither far nor near, Oh! what a wretched Mother I!' She stops, she stands, she looks about; Which way to turn she cannot tell. Poor Betty! it would ease her pain If she had heart to knock again; --The clock strikes three--a dismal knell! Then up along the town she hies, No wonder if her senses fail; This piteous news so much it shocked her, She quite forgot to send the Doctor, To comfort poor old Susan Gale. And now she's high upon the down, And she can see a mile of road: 'O cruel! I'm almost threescore; Such night as this was ne'er before, There's not a single soul abroad.' She listens, but she cannot hear The foot of horse, the voice of man; The streams with softest sound are flowing, The grass you almost hear it growing, You hear it now, if e'er you can. The owlets through the long blue night Are shouting to each other still: Fond lovers! yet not quite hob nob, They lengthen out the tremulous sob, That echoes far from hill to hill. Poor Betty now has lost all hope, Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin, A green-grown pond she just has past, And from the brink she hurries fast, Lest she should drown herself therein. And now she sits her down and weeps; Such tears she never shed before; 'Oh dear, dear Pony! my sweet joy! Oh carry back my Idiot Boy! 0 And we will ne'er o'erload thee more.' A thought is come into her head: The Pony he is mild and good, And we have always used him well; Perhaps he's gone along the dell, And carried Johnny to the wood. Then up she springs as if on wings; She thinks no more of deadly sin; If Betty fifty ponds should see, The last of all her thoughts would be To drown herself therein. O Reader! now that I might tell What Johnny and his Horse are doing What they've been doing all this time, Oh could I put it into rhyme, A most delightful tale pursuing! Perhaps, and no unlikely thought! He with his Pony now doth roam The cliffs and peaks so high that are, To lay his hands upon a star, And in his pocket bring it home. Perhaps he's turned himself about, His face unto his horse's tail, And, still and mute, in wonder lost, All silent as a horseman-ghost, He travels slowly down the vale. And now, perhaps, is hunting sheep, A fierce and dreadful hunter he; Yon valley, now so trim and green, In five months' time, should he be seen, A desert wilderness will be! Perhaps, with head and heels on fire, And like the very soul of evil, He's galloping away, away, And so will gallop on for aye, The bane of all that dread the devil! I to the Muses have been bound These fourteen years, by strong indentures: O gentle Muses! let me tell But half of what to him befell; He surely met with strange adventures. O gentle Muses! is this kind? Why will ye thus my suit repel? Why of your further aid bereave me? And can ye thus unfriended leave me Ye Muses! whom I love so well? Who's yon, that, near the waterfall, Which thunders down with headlong force, Beneath the moon, yet shining fair, As careless as if nothing were, Sits upright on a feeding horse? Unto his horse--there feeding free, He seems, I think, the rein to give; Of moon or stars he takes no heed; Of such we in romances read: --'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live. And that's the very Pony, too! Where is she, where is Betty Foy? She hardly can sustain her fears; The roaring waterfall she hears, And cannot find her Idiot Boy. Your Pony's worth his weight in gold: Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy! She's coming from among the trees, And now all full in view she sees Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. And Betty sees the Pony too: Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy? It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost, 'Tis he whom you so long have lost, He whom you love, your Idiot Boy. She looks again--her arms are up-- She screams--she cannot move for joy; She darts, as with a torrent's force, She almost has o'erturned the Horse, And fast she holds her Idiot Boy. And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud; Whether in cunning or in joy I cannot tell; but while he laughs, Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs To hear again her Idiot Boy. And now she's at the Pony's tail, And now is at the Pony's head,-- On that side now, and now on this; And, almost stifled with her bliss, A few sad tears does Betty shed. She kisses o'er and o'er again Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy; She's happy here, is happy there, She is uneasy every where; Her limbs are all alive with joy. She pats the Pony, where or when She knows not, happy Betty Foy! The little Pony glad may be, But he is milder far than she, You hardly can perceive his joy. 'Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor; You've done your best, and that is all:' She took the reins, when this was said, And gently turned the Pony's head 0 From the loud waterfall. By this the stars were almost gone, The moon was setting on the hill, So pale you scarcely looked at her: The little birds began to stir, Though yet their tongues were still. The Pony, Betty, and her Boy, Wind slowly through the woody dale; And who is she, betimes abroad, That hobbles up the steep rough road? Who is it, but old Susan Gale? Long time lay Susan lost in thought; And many dreadful fears beset her, Both for her Messenger and Nurse; And, as her mind grew worse and worse, Her body--it grew better. She turned, she tossed herself in bed, On all sides doubts and terrors met her; Point after point did she discuss; And, while her mind was fighting thus, Her body still grew better. 'Alas! what is become of them? These fears can never be endured; I'll to the wood.'--The word scarce said, Did Susan rise up from her bed, As if by magic cured. Away she goes up hill and down, And to the wood at length is come; She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting; Oh me! it is a merry meeting As ever was in Christendom. The owls have hardly sung their last, While our four travellers homeward wend; The owls have hooted all night long, And with the owls began my song, And with the owls must end. For while they all were travelling home, Cried Betty, 'Tell us, Johnny, do, Where all this long night you have been, What you have heard, what you have seen: And, Johnny, mind you tell us true.' Now Johnny all night long had heard The owls in tuneful concert strive; No doubt too he the moon had seen; For in the moonlight he had been From eight o'clock till five. And thus, to Betty's question, he Made answer, like a traveller bold, (His very words I give to you,) 'The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo, And the sun did shine so cold!' --Thus answered Johnny in his glory, And that was all his travel's story,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness,     Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;Conspiring with him how to load and bless     With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,     And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;          To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells     With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,And still more, later flowers for the bees,Until they think warm days will never cease,     For Summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cell.Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?     Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may findThee sitting careless on a granary floor,     Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,     Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook          Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep     Steady thy laden head across a brook;     Or by a cider-press, with patient look,          Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?     Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,---While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,     And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;Then in a wailful choir, the small gnats mourn     Among the river sallows, borne aloft          Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;     Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft     The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,          And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI remember the night my motherwas stung by a scorpion. Ten hoursof steady rain had driven himto crawl beneath a sack of rice.Parting with his poison - flash of diabolic tail in the dark room -he risked the rain again.The peasants came like swarms of flies and buzzed the name of God a hundred times to paralyse the Evil One.With candles and with lanterns throwing giant scorpion shadows on the mud-baked wallsthey searched for him: he was not found.They clicked their tongues.With every movement that the scorpion made his poison moved in Mother's blood, they said.May he sit still, they saidMay the sins of your previous birth be burned away tonight, they said.May your suffering decrease the misfortunes of your next birth, they said.May the sum of all evil balanced in this unreal worldagainst the sum of goodbecome diminished by your pain.May the poison purify your fleshof desire, and your spirit of ambition,they said, and they sat aroundon the floor with my mother in the centre,the peace of understanding on each face.More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,more insects, and the endless rain.My mother twisted through and through,groaning on a mat.My father, sceptic, rationalist,trying every curse and blessing,powder, mixture, herb and hybrid.He even poured a little paraffinupon the bitten toe and put a match to it.I watched the flame feeding on my mother.I watched the holy man perform his rites to tame the poison with an incantation.After twenty hours it lost its sting.My mother only said Thank God the scorpion picked on meAnd spared my children.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth. I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain. I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue. A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence. But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat, Of loveliness; When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally; And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one; In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly. ______ Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGo hang yourself, you old M.D.! You shall not sneer at me. Pick up your hat and stethoscope, Go wash your mouth with laundry soap; I contemplate a joy exquisite I'm not paying you for your visit. I did not call you to be told My malady is a common cold. By pounding brow and swollen lip; By fever's hot and scaly grip; By those two red redundant eyes That weep like woeful April skies; By racking snuffle, snort, and sniff; By handkerchief after handkerchief; This cold you wave away as naught Is the damnedest cold man ever caught! Give ear, you scientific fossil! Here is the genuine Cold Colossal; The Cold of which researchers dream, The Perfect Cold, the Cold Supreme. This honored system humbly holds The Super-cold to end all colds; The Cold Crusading for Democracy; The Führer of the Streptococcracy. Bacilli swarm within my portals Such as were ne'er conceived by mortals, But bred by scientists wise and hoary In some Olympic laboratory; Bacteria as large as mice, With feet of fire and heads of ice Who never interrupt for slumber Their stamping elephantine rumba. A common cold, gadzooks, forsooth! Ah, yes. And Lincoln was jostled by Booth; Don Juan was a budding gallant, And Shakespeare's plays show signs of talent; The Arctic winter is fairly coolish, And your diagnosis is fairly foolish. Oh what a derision history holds For the man who belittled the Cold of Colds!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFERRARA.That's my last Duchess painted on the wall,Looking as if she were alive.  I callThat piece a wonder, now: Fr Pandolf's handsWorked busily a day, and there she stands.Will't please you sit and look at her? I said``Fr Pandolf'' by design, for never readStrangers like you that pictured countenance,The depth and passion of its earnest glance,But to myself they turned (since none puts byThe curtain I have drawn for you, but I)And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,How such a glance came there; so, not the firstAre you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 'twas notHer husband's presence only, called that spotOf joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhapsFr Pandolf chanced to say ``Her mantle laps``Over my lady's wrist too much,'' or ``Paint``Must never hope to reproduce the faint``Half-flush that dies along her throat:'' such stuffWas courtesy, she thought, and cause enoughFor calling up that spot of joy.  She hadA heart---how shall I say?---too soon made glad,Too easily impressed; she liked whate'erShe looked on, and her looks went everywhere.  Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,The dropping of the daylight in the West,The bough of cherries some officious foolBroke in the orchard for her, the white muleShe rode with round the terrace---all and eachWould draw from her alike the approving speech,Or blush, at least.  She thanked men,---good! but thankedSomehow---I know not how---as if she rankedMy gift of a nine-hundred-years-old nameWith anybody's gift.  Who'd stoop to blameThis sort of trifling? Even had you skillIn speech---(which I have not)---to make your willQuite clear to such an one, and say, ``Just this``Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,``Or there exceed the mark''---and if she letHerself be lessoned so, nor plainly setHer wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,---E'en then would be some stooping; and I chooseNever to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,Whene'er I passed her; but who passed withoutMuch the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;Then all smiles stopped together.  There she standsAs if alive.  Will't please you rise? We'll meetThe company below, then.  I repeat,The Count your master's known munificenceIs ample warrant that no just pretenceOf mine for dowry will be disallowed;Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowedAt starting, is my object.  Nay, we'll goTogether down, sir.

Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard'Cause I laugh like I've got gold minesDiggin' in my own back yard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise.Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I've got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shameI riseUp from a past that's rooted in painI riseI'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that's wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Xanadu did Kubla KhanA stately pleasure-dome decree :Where Alph, the sacred river, ranThrough caverns measureless to man     Down to a sunless sea.So twice five miles of fertile groundWith walls and towers were girdled round :And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree ;And here were forests ancient as the hills,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.But oh ! that deep romantic chasm which slantedDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover !A savage place ! as holy and enchantedAs e'er beneath a waning moon was hauntedBy woman wailing for her demon-lover !And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,A mighty fountain momently was forced :Amid whose swift half-intermitted burstHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail :And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and everIt flung up momently the sacred river.Five miles meandering with a mazy motionThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,Then reached the caverns measureless to man,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean :And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from farAncestral voices prophesying war !     The shadow of the dome of pleasure     Floated midway on the waves ;     Where was heard the mingled measure     From the fountain and the caves.It was a miracle of rare device,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice !     A damsel with a dulcimer     In a vision once I saw :     It was an Abyssinian maid,     And on her dulcimer she played,     Singing of Mount Abora.     Could I revive within me     Her symphony and song,     To such a deep delight 'twould win me,That with music loud and long,I would build that dome in air,That sunny dome ! those caves of ice !And all who heard should see them there,And all should cry, Beware ! Beware !His flashing eyes, his floating hair !Weave a circle round him thrice,And close your eyes with holy dread,For he on honey-dew hath fed,And drunk the milk of Paradise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish into the air.    The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.    The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and shewears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.    But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king'spalace is.    It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsiplant stands.    The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the sevenimpassable seas.    There is none in the world who can find her but myself.    She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; herhair sweeps down upon the floor.    She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewelswill fall from her lips when she smiles.    But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in thecorner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.    When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, stepup to that terrace on the roof.    I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meettogether.    Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where thebarber in the story lives.    But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber inthe story lives.    It is at the corner of the terrace where the pot of the tulsiplant stands.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe world is full of womenwho'd tell me I should be ashamed of myselfif they had the chance. Quit dancing.Get some self-respectand a day job.Right. And minimum wage,and varicose veins, just standingin one place for eight hoursbehind a glass counterbundled up to the neck, instead of naked as a meat sandwich.Selling gloves, or something.Instead of what I do sell.You have to have talent to peddle a thing so nebulousand without material form.Exploited, they'd say. Yes, any wayyou cut it, but I've a choiceof how, and I'll take the money.I do give value.Like preachers, I sell vision,like perfume ads, desireor its facsimile. Like jokesor war, it's all in the timing.I sell men back their worse suspicions:that everything's for sale,and piecemeal. They gaze at me and seea chain-saw murder just before it happens,when thigh, ass, inkblot, crevice, tit, and nippleare still connected.Such hatred leaps in them,my beery worshippers! That, or a blearyhopeless love. Seeing the rows of heads and upturned eyes, imploringbut ready to snap at my ankles,I understand floods and earthquakes, and the urge to step on ants. I keep the beat,and dance for them becausethey can't. The music smells like foxes,crisp as heated metalsearing the nostrilsor humid as August, hazy and languorousas a looted city the day after,when all the rape's been donealready, and the killing,and the survivors wander aroundlooking for garbageto eat, and there's only a bleak exhaustion.Speaking of which, it's the smilingtires me out the most. This, and the pretencethat I can't hear them.And I can't, because I'm after alla foreigner to them.The speech here is all warty gutturals,obvious as a slab of ham,but I come from the province of the godswhere meanings are lilting and oblique.I don't let on to everyone,but lean close, and I'll whisper:My mother was raped by a holy swan.You believe that? You can take me out to dinner. That's what we tell all the husbands.There sure are a lot of dangerous birds around.Not that anyone herebut you would understand.The rest of them would like to watch meand feel nothing. Reduce me to componentsas in a clock factory or abattoir.Crush out the mystery.Wall me up alivein my own body. They'd like to see through me, but nothing is more opaquethan absolute transparency.Look--my feet don't hit the marble!Like breath or a balloon, I'm rising,I hover six inches in the airin my blazing swan-egg of light.You think I'm not a goddess?Try me.This is a torch song.Touch me and you'll burn.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHave you gazed on naked grandeur where there's nothing else to gaze on,    Set pieces and drop-curtain scenes galore,Big mountains heaved to heaven, which the blinding sunsets blazon,    Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar?Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking through it,    Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost?Have you strung your soul to silence? Then for God's sake go and do it;    Hear the challenge, learn the lesson, pay the cost.Have you wandered in the wilderness, the sagebrush desolation,    The bunch-grass levels where the cattle graze?Have you whistled bits of rag-time at the end of all creation,    And learned to know the desert's little ways?Have you camped upon the foothills, have you galloped o'er the ranges,    Have you roamed the arid sun-lands through and through?Have you chummed up with the mesa? Do you know its moods and changes?    Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig aquiver?    (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,    Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,    Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?    Then hearken to the Wild -- it's wanting you.Have you suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down, yet grasped at glory,    Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?\"Done things\" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,    Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders?    (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things --    Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,    They have soaked you in convention through and through;They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching --    But can't you hear the Wild? -- it's calling you.Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;    Let us journey to a lonely land I know.There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,    And the Wild is calling, calling . . . let us go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a Smile of Love And there is a Smile of Deceit And there is a Smile of SmilesIn which these two Smiles meet And there is a Frown of Hate And there is a Frown of disdain And there is a Frown of FrownsWhich you strive to forget in vain For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core And it sticks in the deep Back bone And no Smile that ever was smild But only one Smile aloneThat betwixt the Cradle & GraveIt only once Smild can be But when it once is Smild Theres an end to all Misery\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t     FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded     A plaintful story from a sistering vale,     My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,     And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;     Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,     Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,     Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.     Upon her head a platted hive of straw,     Which fortified her visage from the sun,     Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw     The carcass of beauty spent and done:     Time had not scythed all that youth begun,     Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,     Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.     Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,     Which on it had conceited characters,     Laundering the silken figures in the brine     That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,     And often reading what contents it bears;     As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,     In clamours of all size, both high and low.     Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,     As they did battery to the spheres intend;     Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied     To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend     Their view right on; anon their gazes lend     To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,     The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.     Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,     Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride     For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,     Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;     Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,     And true to bondage would not break from thence,     Though slackly braided in loose negligence.     A thousand favours from a maund she drew     Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,     Which one by one she in a river threw,     Upon whose weeping margent she was set;     Like usury, applying wet to wet,     Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall     Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.     Of folded schedules had she many a one,     Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;     Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone     Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;     Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,     With sleided silk feat and affectedly     Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.     These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,     And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:     Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,     What unapproved witness dost thou bear!     Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'     This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,     Big discontent so breaking their contents.     A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--     Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew     Of court, of city, and had let go by     The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--     Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,     And, privileged by age, desires to know     In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.     So slides he down upon his grained bat,     And comely-distant sits he by her side;     When he again desires her, being sat,     Her grievance with his hearing to divide:     If that from him there may be aught applied     Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,     'Tis promised in the charity of age.     'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold     The injury of many a blasting hour,     Let it not tell your judgment I am old;     Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:     I might as yet have been a spreading flower,     Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied     Love to myself and to no love beside.     'But, woe is me! too early I attended     A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--     Of one by nature's outwards so commended,     That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:     Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;     And when in his fair parts she did abide,     She was new lodged and newly deified.     'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;     And every light occasion of the wind     Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.     What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:     Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,     For on his visage was in little drawn     What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.     'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;     His phoenix down began but to appear     Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin     Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:     Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;     And nice affections wavering stood in doubt     If best were as it was, or best without.     'His qualities were beauteous as his form,     For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;     Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm     As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,     When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.     His rudeness so with his authorized youth     Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.     'Well could he ride, and often men would say     'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:     Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,     What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop     he makes!'     And controversy hence a question takes,     Whether the horse by him became his deed,     Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.     'But quickly on this side the verdict went:     His real habitude gave life and grace     To appertainings and to ornament,     Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:     All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,     Came for additions; yet their purposed trim     Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.     'So on the tip of his subduing tongue     All kinds of arguments and question deep,     All replication prompt, and reason strong,     For his advantage still did wake and sleep:     To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,     He had the dialect and different skill,     Catching all passions in his craft of will:     'That he did in the general bosom reign     Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,     To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain     In personal duty, following where he haunted:     Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;     And dialogued for him what he would say,     Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.     'Many there were that did his picture get,     To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;     Like fools that in th' imagination set     The goodly objects which abroad they find     Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;     And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them     Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:     'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,     Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.     My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,     And was my own fee-simple, not in part,     What with his art in youth, and youth in art,     Threw my affections in his charmed power,     Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.     'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,     Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;     Finding myself in honour so forbid,     With safest distance I mine honour shielded:     Experience for me many bulwarks builded     Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil     Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.

'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'     And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;     Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,     Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;     Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;     Thought characters and words merely but art,     And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.

''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,     With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,     I have received from many a several fair,     Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,     With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,     And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify     Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.

''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,     Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,     Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,     But yield them up where I myself must render,     That is, to you, my origin and ender;     For these, of force, must your oblations be,     Since I their altar, you enpatron me.

''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:     The accident which brought me to her eye     Upon the moment did her force subdue,     And now she would the caged cloister fly:     Religious love put out Religion's eye:     Not to be tempted, would she be immured,     And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.

Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,     'gainst shame,     And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,     The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.     ''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,     Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;     And supplicant their sighs to you extend,     To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,     Lending soft audience to my sweet design,     And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath     That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'     'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,     Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;     Each cheek a river running from a fount     With brinish current downward flow'd apace:     O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!     Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses     That flame through water which their hue encloses.     'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies     In the small orb of one particular tear!     But with the inundation of the eyes     What rocky heart to water will not wear?     What breast so cold that is not warmed here?     O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,     Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.     'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,     Even there resolved my reason into tears;     There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,     Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;     Appear to him, as he to me appears,     All melting; though our drops this difference bore,     His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.

'That not a heart which in his level came     Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,     Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;     And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:     Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;     When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,     He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.     'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace     The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;     That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,     Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.

Federico, do you rememberfrom under the groundmy balconies on whichthe light of June drowned flowers in your mouth?Brother, my brother!Everythingloud with big voices, the salt of merchandises,pile-ups of palpitating bread,the stalls of my suburb of Arguelles with its statuelike a drained inkwell in a swirl of hake:oil flowed into spoons,a deep bayingof feet and hands swelled in the streets,metres, litres, the sharpmeasure of life,stacked-up fish,the texture of roofs with a cold sun in whichthe weather vane falters,the fine, frenzied ivory of potatoes,wave on wave of tomatoes rolling down the sea.And one morning all that was burning,one morning the bonfiresleapt out of the earthdevouring human beings --and from then on fire,gunpowder from then on,and from then on blood.Bandits with planes and Moors,bandits with finger-rings and duchesses,bandits with black friars spattering blessingscame through the sky to kill childrenand the blood of children ran through the streetswithout fuss, like children's blood.Jackals that the jackals would despise,stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out,vipers that the vipers would abominate!Face to face with you I have seen the bloodof Spain tower like a tideto drown you in one waveof pride and knives!Treacherousgenerals:see my dead house,look at broken Spain :from every house burning metal flowsinstead of flowers,from every socket of SpainSpain emergesand from every dead child a rifle with eyes,and from every crime bullets are bornwhich will one day findthe bull's eye of your hearts.And you'll ask: why doesn't his poetryspeak of dreams and leavesand the great volcanoes of his native land?Come and see the blood in the streets.Come and seeThe blood in the streets.Come and see the bloodIn the streets!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLIFE, believe, is not a dream  So dark as sages say;Oft a little morning rain  Foretells a pleasant day. Sometimes there are clouds of gloom,  But these are transient all;If the shower will make the roses bloom,  O why lament its fall ?     Rapidly, merrily,  Life's sunny hours flit by,    Gratefully, cheerily,  Enjoy them as they fly ! What though Death at times steps in  And calls our Best away ?What though sorrow seems to win,  O'er hope, a heavy sway ?Yet hope again elastic springs,  Unconquered, though she fell;Still buoyant are her golden wings,  Still strong to bear us well.    Manfully, fearlessly,  The day of trial bear,    For gloriously, victoriously,  Can courage quell despair !\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIn lifeone is alwaysbalancinglike we juggle our mothersagainst our fathersor one teacheragainst another(only to balance our grade average)  3 grains of saltto one ounce truthour sweet black essenceor the funky honkies down the streetand lately i've begun wonderingif you're trying to tell me somethingwe used to talk all nightand do things alone togetherand i've begun(as a reaction to a feeling)  to balancethe pleasure of lonelinessagainst the painof loving you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat passing-bells for these who die as cattle? Only the monstrous anger of the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle Can patter out their hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs, The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells; And bugles calling for them from sad shires. What candles may be held to speed them all? Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes. The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall; Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy son aged three fell in the nettle bed.'Bed' seemed a curious name for those green spears,That regiment of spite behind the shed:It was no place for rest.  With sobs and tearsThe boy came seeking comfort and I sawWhite blisters beaded on his tender skin.We soothed him till his pain was not so raw.At last he offered us a watery grin,And then I took my billhook, honed the bladeAnd went outside and slashed in fury with itTill not a nettle in that fierce paradeStood upright any more.  And then I litA funeral pyre to burn the fallen dead,But in two weeks the busy sun and rainHad called up tall recruits behind the shed:My son would often feel sharp wounds again.Submitted by Andrew Mayers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFor months my hand was sealed off in a tin box. Nothing was there but the subway railings. Perhaps it is bruised, I thought, and that is why they have locked it up. You could tell time by this, I thought, like a clock, by its five knuckles and the thin underground veins. It lay there like an unconscious woman fed by tubes she knew not of. The hand had collapse, a small wood pigeon that had gone into seclusion. I turned it over and the palm was old, its lines traced like fine needlepoint and stitched up into fingers. It was fat and soft and blind in places. Nothing but vulnerable. And all this is metaphor. An ordinary hand - just lonely for something to touch that touches back. The dog won't do it. Her tail wags in the swamp for a frog. I'm no better than a case of dog food. She owns her own hunger. My sisters won't do it. They live in school except for buttons and tears running down like lemonade. My father won't do it. He comes in the house and even at night he lives in a machine made by my mother and well oiled by his job, his job. The trouble is that I'd let my gestures freeze. The trouble was not in the kitchen or the tulips but only in my head, my head. Then all this became history. Your hand found mine. Life rushed to my fingers like a blood clot. Oh, my carpenter, the fingers are rebuilt. They dance with yours. They dance in the attic and in Vienna. My hand is alive all over America. Not even death will stop it, death shedding her blood. Nothing will stop it, for this is the kingdom and the kingdom come.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis saltin the salt cellarI once saw in the salt mines.I knowyou won'tbelieve mebutit singssalt sings, the skinof the salt minessingswith a mouth smotheredby the earth.I shivered in thosesolitudeswhen I heardthe voiceofthe salt in the desert.Near Antofagastathe nitrouspamparesounds:abrokenvoice,a mournfulsong.In its cavesthe salt moans, mountainof buried light,translucent cathedral,crystal of the sea, oblivionof the waves.And then on every tablein the world,salt,we see your piquantpowdersprinklingvital lightuponour food.

Not there. I try the Back Bay. Not there. Not there. And yet I know the number. 45 Mercy Street. I know the stained-glass window of the foyer, the three flights of the house with its parquet floors. I know the furniture and mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, the servants. I know the cupboard of Spode the boat of ice, solid silver, where the butter sits in neat squares like strange giant's teeth on the big mahogany table. I know it well. Not there. Where did you go? 45 Mercy Street, with great-grandmother kneeling in her whale-bone corset and praying gently but fiercely to the wash basin, at five A.M. at noon dozing in her wiggy rocker, grandfather taking a nap in the pantry, grandmother pushing the bell for the downstairs maid, and Nana rocking Mother with an oversized flower on her forehead to cover the curl of when she was good and when she was... And where she was begat and in a generation the third she will beget, me, with the stranger's seed blooming into the flower called Horrid. I walk in a yellow dress and a white pocketbook stuffed with cigarettes, enough pills, my wallet, my keys, and being twenty-eight, or is it forty-five? I walk. I walk. I hold matches at street signs for it is dark, as dark as the leathery dead and I have lost my green Ford, my house in the suburbs, two little kids sucked up like pollen by the bee in me and a husband who has wiped off his eyes in order not to see my inside out and I am walking and looking and this is no dream just my oily life where the people are alibis and the street is unfindable for an entire lifetime. Pull the shades down - I don't care! Bolt the door, mercy, erase the number, rip down the street sign, what can it matter, what can it matter to this cheapskate who wants to own the past that went out on a dead ship and left me only with paper? Not there. I open my pocketbook, as women do, and fish swim back and forth between the dollars and the lipstick. I pick them out, one by one and throw them at the street signs, and shoot my pocketbook into the Charles River. Next I pull the dream off and slam into the cement wall of the clumsy calendar I live in, my life, and its hauled up notebooks.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlas! they had been friends in youth;But whispering tongues can poison truth;And constancy lives in realms above;And life is thorny; and youth is vain;And to be wroth with one we love,Doth work like madness in the brain.And thus is chanced, as I divine,With Roland and Sir Leoline.Each spake words of high disdainAnd insult to his heart's best brother:They parted - ne'er to meet again!But never either found anotherTo free the hollow heart from painting -They stood aloof, the scars remaining,Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;A dreary see now flows between; -But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunderShall wholly do away, I ween,The marks of that which once hath been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou fit into melike a hook into an eyea fish hookan open eye\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLet the snake wait underhis weedand the writingbe of words, slow and quick, sharpto strike, quiet to wait,sleepless.-- through metaphor to reconcilethe people and the stones.Compose.

May his wonderful and gentle soul continue to rest in the Bosom Of Almighty God.MZANSI is another name for South Africa - an affectionate name.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou may write me down in historyWith your bitter, twisted lies,You may tread me in the very dirtBut still, like dust, I'll rise.Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wellsPumping in my living room.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I'll rise.Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops.Weakened by my soulful cries.Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard'Cause I laugh like I've got gold minesDiggin' in my own back yard.You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefulness,But still, like air, I'll rise.Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surpriseThat I dance like I've got diamondsAt the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shameI riseUp from a past that's rooted in painI riseI'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.Leaving behind nights of terror and fearI riseInto a daybreak that's wondrously clearI riseBringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,I am the dream and the hope of the slave.I riseI riseI rise.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Rock, A River, A TreeHosts to species long since departed,Mark the mastodon.The dinosaur, who left dry tokensOf their sojourn hereOn our planet floor,Any broad alarm of their of their hastening doomIs lost in the gloom of dust and ages.But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,Come, you may stand upon myBack and face your distant destiny,But seek no haven in my shadow.I will give you no hiding place down here.You, created only a little lower thanThe angels, have crouched too long inThe bruising darkness,Have lain too longFace down in ignorance.Your mouths spelling wordsArmed for slaughter.The rock cries out today, you may stand on me,But do not hide your face.Across the wall of the world,A river sings a beautiful song,Come rest here by my side.Each of you a bordered country,Delicate and strangely made proud,Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.Your armed struggles for profitHave left collars of waste uponMy shore, currents of debris upon my breast.Yet, today I call you to my riverside,If you will study war no more.Come, clad in peace and I will sing the songsThe Creator gave to me when IAnd the tree and stone were one.Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your browAnd when you yet knew you still knew nothing.The river sings and sings on.There is a true yearning to respond toThe singing river and the wise rock.So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew,The African and Native American, the Sioux,The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek,The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheikh,The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,The privileged, the homeless, the teacher.They hear. They all hearThe speaking of the tree.Today, the first and last of every treeSpeaks to humankind. Come to me, here beside the river.Plant yourself beside me, here beside the river.Each of you, descendant of some passed onTraveller, has been paid for.You, who gave me my first name,You Pawnee, Apache and Seneca,You Cherokee Nation, who rested with me,Then forced on bloody feet,Left me to the employment of other seekers- Desperate for gain, starving for gold.You, the Turk, the Swede, the German, the Scot...You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru,Bought, sold, stolen, arriving on a nightmarePraying for a dream.Here, root yourselves beside me.I am the tree planted by the river,Which will not be moved.I, the rock, I the river, I the treeI am yours- your passages have been paid.Lift up your faces, you have a piercing needFor this bright morning dawning for you.History, despite its wrenching pain,Cannot be unlived, and if faced with courage,Need not be lived again.Lift up your eyes uponThe day breaking for you.Give birth againTo the dream.Women, children, men,Take it into the palms of your hands.Mold it into the shape of your mostPrivate need. Sculpt it intoThe image of your most public self.Lift up your hearts.Each new hour holds new chancesFor new beginnings.Do not be wedded foreverTo fear, yoked eternallyTo brutishness.The horizon leans forward,Offering you space to place new steps of change.Here, on the pulse of this fine dayYou may have the courageTo look up and out upon me,The rock, the river, the tree, your country.No less to Midas than the mendicant.No less to you now than the mastodon then.Here on the pulse of this new dayYou may have the grace to look up and outAnd into your sister's eyes,Into your brother's face, your countryAnd say simplyVery simplyWith hopeGood morning.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI WILL arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee,And live alone in the bee-loud glade.And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,And evening full of the linnet's wings.I will arise and go now, for always night and dayI hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,I hear it in the deep heart's core.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOur Andy's gone to battle now  'Gainst Drought, the red marauder; Our Andy's gone with cattle now  Across the Queensland border.  He's left us in dejection now;  Our hearts with him are roving. It's dull on this selection now,  Since Andy went a-droving.  Who now shall wear the cheerful face  In times when things are slackest? And who shall whistle round the place  When Fortune frowns her blackest?  Oh, who shall cheek the squatter now  When he comes round us snarling? His tongue is growing hotter now  Since Andy cross'd the Darling.  The gates are out of order now,  In storms the `riders' rattle; For far across the border now  Our Andy's gone with cattle.  Poor Aunty's looking thin and white;  And Uncle's cross with worry; And poor old Blucher howls all night  Since Andy left Macquarie.  Oh, may the showers in torrents fall,  And all the tanks run over; And may the grass grow green and tall  In pathways of the drover;  And may good angels send the rain  On desert stretches sandy; And when the summer comes again  God grant 'twill bring us Andy.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI was angry with my friend:I told my wrath, my wrath did end.I was angry with my foe:I told it not, my wrath did grow.And I watered it in fears,Night and morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles,And with soft deceitful wiles.And it grew both day and night,Till it bore an apple bright.And my foe beheld it shine.And he knew that it was mine,And into my garden stoleWhen the night had veiled the pole; In the morning glad I seeMy foe outstretched beneath the tree.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhose woods these are I think I know.His house is in the village, though; He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow.My little horse must think it queerTo stop without a farmhouse nearBetween the woods and frozen lakeThe darkest evening of the year.He gives his harness bells a shakeTo ask if there is some mistake.The only other sound's the sweepOf easy wind and downy flake.The woods are lovely, dark and deep,But I have promises to keep,And miles to go before I sleep,And miles to go before I sleep.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLying, thinkingLast nightHow to find my soul a homeWhere water is not thirstyAnd bread loaf is not stoneI came up with one thingAnd I don't believe I'm wrongThat nobody,But nobodyCan make it out here alone.Alone, all aloneNobody, but nobodyCan make it out here alone.There are some millionairesWith money they can't useTheir wives run round like bansheesTheir children sing the bluesThey've got expensive doctorsTo cure their hearts of stone.But nobodyNo, nobodyCan make it out here alone.Alone, all aloneNobody, but nobodyCan make it out here alone.Now if you listen closelyI'll tell you what I knowStorm clouds are gatheringThe wind is gonna blowThe race of man is sufferingAnd I can hear the moan,'Cause nobody,But nobodyCan make it out here alone.Alone, all aloneNobody, but nobodyCan make it out here alone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCall the roller of big cigars,The muscular one, and bid him whipIn kitchen cups concupiscent curds.Let the wenches dawdle in such dressAs they are used to wear, and let the boysBring flowers in last month's newspapers.Let be be finale of seem.The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.Take from the dresser of deal.Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheetOn which she embroidered fantails onceAnd spread it so as to cover her face.If her horny feet protrude, they comeTo show how cold she is, and dumb.Let the lamp affix its beam.The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'No animal is half as vileAs Crocky-Wock, the crocodile.On Saturdays he likes to crunchSix juicy children for his lunchAnd he especially enjoysJust three of each, three girls, three boys.He smears the boys (to make them hot)With mustard from the mustard pot.But mustard doesn't go with girls,It tastes all wrong with plaits and curls.With them, what goes extremely wellIs butterscotch and caramel.It's such a super marvelous treatWhen boys are hot and girls are sweet.At least that's Crocky's point of viewHe ought to know.

I wish this all made sense, I wish I understood.Not having you here with me is tearing me up inside, but I can't stop thinking about you no matter how hard I try.You know how I feel about you, and I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you, but it's so hard to do when I can't even be next to you.Why does it got to be so complicated? Loving you feels so right, but at the same time, knowing I can't have you keeps me awake at night.I just want this to be simple, I just want you here with me, to look into your eyes, be held in your arms...then I'd truly be happy.Right now this distance between us is out of our control, but I'm still hoping one day soon, I'll get what I'm wishing for.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy heart was heavy, for its trust had been Abused, its kindness answered with foul wrong; So, turning gloomily from my fellow-men, One summer Sabbath day I strolled among The green mounds of the village burial-place; Where, pondering how all human love and hate Find one sad level; and how, soon or late, Wronged and wrongdoer, each with meekened face, And cold hands folded over a still heart, Pass the green threshold of our common grave, Whither all footsteps tend, whence none depart, Awed for myself, and pitying my race, Our common sorrow, like a mighty wave, Swept all my pride away, and trembling I forgave!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tyour life is your lifedon't let it be clubbed into dank submission.be on the watch.there are ways out.there is a light somewhere.it may not be much light butit beats the darkness.be on the watch.the gods will offer you chances.know them.take them.you can't beat death butyou can beat death in life, sometimes.and the more often you learn to do it,the more light there will be.your life is your life.know it while you have it.you are marvelousthe gods wait to delightin you.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think, no matter where you stray,That I shall go with you a way.Though you may wander sweeter lands,You will not soon forget my hands,Nor yet the way I held my head,Nor all the tremulous things I said.You still will see me, small and whiteAnd smiling, in the secret night,And feel my arms about you whenThe day comes fluttering back again.I think, no matter where you be,You'll hold me in your memoryAnd keep my image, there without me,By telling later loves about me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere is a place where the sidewalk endsand before the street begins,and there the grass grows soft and white,and there the sun burns crimson bright,and there the moon-bird rests from his flightto cool in the peppermint wind.Let us leave this place where the smoke blows blackand the dark street winds and bends.Past the pits where the asphalt flowers growwe shall walk with a walk that is measured and slowand watch where the chalk-white arrows goto the place where the sidewalk ends.Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,the place where the sidewalk ends.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t------The sky is overcast With a continuous cloud of texture close, Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon, Which through that veil is indistinctly seen, A dull, contracted circle, yielding light So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls, Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower. At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam Startles the pensive traveller while he treads His lonesome path, with unobserving eye Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split Asunder,--and above his head he sees The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens. There, in a black-blue vault she sails along, Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away, Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree, But they are silent;--still they roll along Immeasurably distant; and the vault, Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds, Still deepens its unfathomable depth. At length the Vision closes; and the mind, Not undisturbed by the delight it feels, Which slowly settles into peaceful calm, Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe weight of the worldis love.Under the burdenof solitude,under the burdenof dissatisfactionthe weight,the weight we carryis love.Who can deny?In dreamsit touchesthe body,in thoughtconstructsa miracle,in imaginationanguishestill bornin human--looks out of the heartburning with purity--for the burden of lifeis love,but we carry the weightwearily,and so must restin the arms of loveat last,must rest in the armsof love.No restwithout love,no sleepwithout dreamsof love--be mad or chillobsessed with angelsor machines,the final wishis love--cannot be bitter,cannot deny,cannot withholdif denied:the weight is too heavy--must givefor no returnas thoughtis givenin solitudein all the excellenceof its excess.The warm bodiesshine togetherin the darkness,the hand movesto the centerof the flesh,the skin tremblesin happinessand the soul comesjoyful to the eye--yes, yes,that's whatI wanted,I always wanted,I always wanted,to returnto the bodywhere I was born.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthere is enough treachery, hatred violence absurdity in the averagehuman being to supply any given army on any given dayand the best at murder are those who preach against itand the best at hate are those who preach loveand the best at war finally are those who preach peacethose who preach god, need godthose who preach peace do not have peacethose who preach peace do not have lovebeware the preachersbeware the knowersbeware those who are always reading booksbeware those who either detest povertyor are proud of itbeware those quick to praisefor they need praise in returnbeware those who are quick to censorthey are afraid of what they do not knowbeware those who seek constant crowds forthey are nothing alonebeware the average man the average womanbeware their love, their love is averageseeks averagebut there is genius in their hatredthere is enough genius in their hatred to kill youto kill anybodynot wanting solitudenot understanding solitudethey will attempt to destroy anythingthat differs from their ownnot being able to create artthey will not understand artthey will consider their failure as creatorsonly as a failure of the worldnot being able to love fullythey will believe your love incompleteand then they will hate youand their hatred will be perfectlike a shining diamondlike a knifelike a mountainlike a tigerlike hemlocktheir finest artSubmitted by Holt\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSunset and evening star,  And one clear call for me!And may there be no moaning of the bar,  When I put out to sea,But such a tide as moving seems asleep,    Too full for sound and foam,When that which drew from out the boundless deep    Turns again home.Twilight and evening bell,And after that the dark!And may there be no sadness of farewell,    When I embark;For though from out our bourne of Time and Place    The flood may bear me far,I hope to see my Pilot face to face    When I have crost the bar.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he      knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so      much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my      state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that.  The      church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she      does belongs to all.  When she baptizes a child, that action      concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which      is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member.      And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is      of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is      not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language;      and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several      translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness,      some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every      translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves      again for that library where every book shall lie open to one      another.  As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not      upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this      bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the      door by this sickness.  There was a contention as far as a suit (in      which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were      mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers      first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring      first that rose earliest.  If we understand aright the dignity of      this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to      make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be      ours as well as his, whose indeed it is.  The bell doth toll for him      that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that      minute that this occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God.      Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes      off his eye from a comet when that breaks out?  Who bends not his      ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove      it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this      world?  No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece      of the continent, a part of the main.  If a clod be washed away by      the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as      well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's      death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and      therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for      thee.  Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing      of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but      must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the      misery of our neighbours.  Truly it were an excusable covetousness      if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath      enough of it.  No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and      ripened by it, and made fit for God by that affliction.  If a man      carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none      coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he      travels.  Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not      current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our      home, heaven, by it.  Another man may be sick too, and sick to      death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a      mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his      affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this      consideration of another's danger I take mine own into      contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my      God, who is our only security.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI went to turn the grass once after one Who mowed it in the dew before the sun. The dew was gone that made his blade so keen Before I came to view the levelled scene. I looked for him behind an isle of trees; I listened for his whetstone on the breeze. But he had gone his way, the grass all mown, And I must be, as he had been,—alone, 'As all must be,' I said within my heart, 'Whether they work together or apart.' But as I said it, swift there passed me by On noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly, Seeking with memories grown dim over night Some resting flower of yesterday's delight. And once I marked his flight go round and round, As where some flower lay withering on the ground. And then he flew as far as eye could see, And then on tremulous wing came back to me. I thought of questions that have no reply, And would have turned to toss the grass to dry; But he turned first, and led my eye to look At a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook, A leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared Beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared. I left my place to know them by their name, Finding them butterfly-weed when I came. The mower in the dew had loved them thus, By leaving them to flourish, not for us, Nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him, But from sheer morning gladness at the brim. The butterfly and I had lit upon, Nevertheless, a message from the dawn, That made me hear the wakening birds around, And hear his long scythe whispering to the ground, And feel a spirit kindred to my own; So that henceforth I worked no more alone; But glad with him, I worked as with his aid, And weary, sought at noon with him the shade; And dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech With one whose thought I had not hoped to reach. 'Men work together,' I told him from the heart, 'Whether they work together or apart.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t                                          PART ONE                                                 I    THE wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,     The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     And the highwayman came riding—                       Riding—riding—     The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,     A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;     They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!     And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,                       His pistol butts a-twinkle,     His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.                                                 III    Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,     And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;     He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.                                                 IV    And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked     Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;     His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,     But he loved the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's red-lipped daughter,     Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—                                                 V    'One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night,     But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;     Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,     Then look for me by moonlight,                       Watch for me by moonlight,     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.'                                                 VI    He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,     But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand     As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;     And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,                       (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)     Then he tugged at his rein in the moonliglt, and galloped away to the West.                                         PART TWO                                                 I    He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;     And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,     When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,     A red-coat troop came marching—                       Marching—marching—     King George's men came matching, up to the old inn-door.                                                 II    They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,     But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;     Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!     There was death at every window;                       And hell at one dark window;     For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.                                                 III    They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;     They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!     'Now, keep good watch!' and they kissed her.                       She heard the dead man say—     Look for me by moonlight;                       Watch for me by moonlight;     I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!                                                 IV    She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!     She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!     They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,     Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,                       Cold, on the stroke of midnight,     The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers!                                                 V    The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!     Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,     She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;     For the road lay bare in the moonlight;                       Blank and bare in the moonlight;     And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain .                                                 VI        Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear;     Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear?     Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,     The highwayman came riding,                       Riding, riding!     The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still!                                                 VII    Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!     Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!     Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,     Then her finger moved in the moonlight,                       Her musket shattered the moonlight,     Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.                                                 VIII    He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood     Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!     Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear     How Bess, the landlord's daughter,                       The landlord's black-eyed daughter,     Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.                                                 IX    Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,     With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!     Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,     When they shot him down on the highway,                       Down like a dog on the highway,     And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.                                                 X    And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,     When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,     When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,     A highwayman comes riding—                       Riding—riding—     A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.                                                 XI    Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;     He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;     He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there     But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,                       Bess, the landlord's daughter,     Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,        Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,   Sylvan historian, who canst thus express       A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:   What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape       Of deities or mortals, or of both,           In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?       What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?   What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?           What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?   Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard       Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;   Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,       Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:   Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave       Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;           Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,   Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;       She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,           For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!   Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed       Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;   And, happy melodist, unwearied,       For ever piping songs for ever new;   More happy love! more happy, happy love!       For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,           For ever panting, and for ever young;   All breathing human passion far above,       That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,           A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.   Who are these coming to the sacrifice?       To what green altar, O mysterious priest,   Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,       And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?   What little town by river or sea shore,       Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,           Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?   And, little town, thy streets for evermore       Will silent be; and not a soul to tell           Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.   O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede       Of marble men and maidens overwrought,   With forest branches and the trodden weed;       Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought   As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!       When old age shall this generation waste,           Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe   Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,       \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,--that is all           Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI knew a simple soldier boyWho grinned at life in empty joy,Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,And whistled early with the lark.In winter trenches, cowed and glum,With crumps and lice and lack of rum,He put a bullet through his brain.No one spoke of him again.You smug-faced crowds with kindling eyeWho cheer when soldier lads march by,Sneak home and pray you'll never knowThe hell where youth and laughter go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA beestaggers out    of the peony.Translated by Robert Hass\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI make a pact with you, Walt Whitman - I have detested you long enough.I come to you as a grown childWho has had a pig-headed father;I am old enough now to make friends.It was you that broke the new wood,Now is a time for carving.We have one sap and one root - Let there be commerce between us.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Veruca Salt, the little brute,Has just gone down the garbage chute,(And as we very rightly thoughtThat in a case like this we oughtTo see the thing completely through,We've polished off her parents, too.)Down goes Veruca! Down the drain!And here, perhaps, we should explainThat she will meet, as she descends,A rather different set of friendsTo those that she has left behind–These won't be nearly so refined.A fish head, for example, cutThis morning from a halibut.'Hello! Good morning! How d'you do?How nice to meet you! How are you?'And then a little further downA mass of others gather round:A bacon rind, some rancid lard,A loaf of bread gone stale and hard,A steak that nobody could chew,An oyster from an oyster stew,Some liverwurst so old and grayOne smelled it from a mile away,A rotten nut, a reeky pear,A thing the cat left on the stair,And lots of other things as well,Each with a rather horrid smell.These are Veruca's new found friendsThat she will meet as she descends,And this is the price she has to payFor going so very far astray.But now, my dears, we think you mightBe wondering–is it really rightThat every single bit of blameAnd all the scolding and the shameShould fall upon Veruca Salt?Is she the only one at fault?For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,A girl can't spoil herself, you know.Who spoiled her, then? Ah, who indeed?Who pandered to her every need?Who turned her into such a brat?Who are the culprits? Who did that?Alas! You needen't look so farTo find out who these sinners are.They are (and this is very sad)Her loving parents, MUM and DAD.And that is why we're glad they fellInto the garbage chute as well.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are some nights whensleep plays coy,aloof and disdainful.And all the wilesthat I employ to winits service to my sideare useless as wounded pride,and much more painful.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMy father worked with a horse-plough,His shoulders globed like a full sail strungBetween the shafts and the furrow.The horse strained at his clicking tongue. An expert. He would set the wingAnd fit the bright steel-pointed sock.The sod rolled over without breaking.At the headrig, with a single pluck Of reins, the sweating team turned roundAnd back into the land. His eyeNarrowed and angled at the ground,Mapping the furrow exactly. I stumbled in his hob-nailed wake,Fell sometimes on the polished sod;Sometimes he rode me on his backDipping and rising to his plod. I wanted to grow up and plough,To close one eye, stiffen my arm.All I ever did was followIn his broad shadow round the farm. I was a nuisance, tripping, falling,Yapping always. But today It is my father who keeps stumblingBehind me, and will not go away.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd because love battlesnot only in its burning agriculturesbut also in the mouth of men and women,I will finish off by taking the path awayto those who between my chest and your fragrancewant to interpose their obscure plant.About me, nothing worsethey will tell you, my love,than what I told you.I lived in the prairiesbefore I got to know youand I did not wait love but I waslaying in wait for and I jumped on the rose.What more can they tell you?I am neither good nor bad but a man,and they will then associate the dangerof my life, which you knowand which with your passion you shared.And good, this dangeris danger of love, of complete lovefor all life,for all lives,and if this love brings usthe death and the prisons,I am sure that your big eyes,as when I kiss them,will then close with pride,into double pride, love,with your pride and my pride.But to my ears they will come beforeto wear down the tourof the sweet and hard love which binds us,and they will say: “The oneyou love,is not a woman for you,Why do you love her? I thinkyou could find one more beautiful,more serious, more deep,more other, you understand me, look how she’s light,and what a head she has,and look at how she dresses,and etcetera and etcetera”.And I in these lines say:Like this I want you, love,love, Like this I love you,as you dressand how your hair lifts upand how your mouth smiles,light as the waterof the spring upon the pure stones,Like this I love you, beloved.To bread I do not ask to teach mebut only not to lack during every day of life.I don’t know anything about light, from whereit comes nor where it goes,I only want the light to light up,I do not ask to the nightexplanations,I wait for it and it envelops me,And so you, bread and lightAnd shadow are.You came to my lifewith what you were bringing,madeof light and bread and shadow I expected you,and Like this I need you,Like this I love you,and to those who want to hear tomorrowthat which I will not tell them, let them read it here,and let them back off today because it is earlyfor these arguments.Tomorrow we will only give thema leaf of the tree of our love, a leafwhich will fall on the earthlike if it had been made by our lipslike a kiss which fallsfrom our invincible heightsto show the fire and the tendernessof a true love.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow close the windows and hush all the fields:If the trees must, let them silently toss;No bird is singing now, and if there is,Be it my loss.It will be long ere the marshes resume,I will be long ere the earliest bird:So close the windows and not hear the wind,But see all wind-stirred.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen I get to be a composerI'm gonna write me some music aboutDaybreak in AlabamaAnd I'm gonna put the purtiest songs in itRising out of the ground like a swamp mistAnd falling out of heaven like soft dew.I'm gonna put some tall tall trees in itAnd the scent of pine needlesAnd the smell of red clay after rainAnd long red necksAnd poppy colored facesAnd big brown armsAnd the field daisy eyesOf black and white black white black peopleAnd I'm gonna put white handsAnd black hands and brown and yellow handsAnd red clay earth hands in itTouching everybody with kind fingersAnd touching each other natural as dewIn that dawn of music when IGet to be a composerAnd write about daybreakIn Alabama.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was too lonely for her there,And too wild,And since there were but two of them,And no child,And work was little in the house,She was free,And followed where he furrowed field,Or felled tree.She rested on a log and tossedThe fresh chips,With a song only to herselfOn her lips.And once she went to break a boughOf black alder.She strayed so far she scarcely heardWhen he called her-And didn't answer-didn't speak-Or return.She stood, and then she ran and hidIn the fern.He never found her, though he lookedEverywhere,And he asked at her mother's houseWas she there.Sudden and swift and light as thatThe ties gave,And he learned of finalitiesBesides the grave.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death.I hear him leading his horse out of the stall; I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.But I will not hold the bridlewhile he clinches the girth.And he may mount by himself: I will not give him a leg up. Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,I will not tell him which way the fox ran.With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where the black boy hides in the swamp.I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;I am not on his pay-roll. I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends nor of my enemies either.Though he promise me much, I will not map him the route to any man's door.Am I a spy in the land of the living,that I should deliver men to Death?Brother, the password and the plans of our city are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShadows on the wallNoises down the hallLife doesn't frighten me at all Bad dogs barking loudBig ghosts in a cloudLife doesn't frighten me at all Mean old Mother GooseLions on the looseThey don't frighten me at all Dragons breathing flameOn my counterpaneThat doesn't frighten me at all.

Panthers in the parkStrangers in the darkNo, they don't frighten me at all. That new classroom whereBoys all pull my hair(Kissy little girlsWith their hair in curls)They don't frighten me at all. Don't show me frogs and snakesAnd listen for my scream,If I'm afraid at allIt's only in my dreams. I've got a magic charmThat I keep up my sleeveI can walk the ocean floorAnd never have to breathe.

His smileIs like an infant's - gentle, without guile.Ah, Nature, keep him warm; he may catch cold.The humming insects don't disturb his rest;He sleeps in sunlight, one hand on his breast;At peace. In his side there are two red holes.Original FrenchLe Dormeur du ValC'est un trou de verdure où chante une rivièreAccrochant follement aux herbes des haillonsD'argent ; où le soleil, de la montagne fière,Luit : c'est un petit val qui mousse de rayons.Un soldat jeune, lèvre bouche ouverte, tête nue,Et la nuque baignant dans le frais cresson bleu,Dort ; il est étendu dans l'herbe sous la nue,Pâle dans son lit vert où la lumière pleut.Les pieds dans les glaïeuls, il dort. Souriant commeSourirait un enfant malade, il fait un somme :Nature, berce-le chaudement : il a froid.Les parfums ne font pas frissonner sa narine ;Il dort dans le soleil, la main sur sa poitrine,Tranquille. Il a deux trous rouges au côté droit.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe most important thing we've learned, So far as children are concerned, Is never, NEVER, NEVER let Them near your television set -- Or better still, just don't install The idiotic thing at all. In almost every house we've been, We've watched them gaping at the screen. They loll and slop and lounge about, And stare until their eyes pop out. (Last week in someone's place we saw A dozen eyeballs on the floor.) They sit and stare and stare and sit Until they're hypnotised by it, Until they're absolutely drunk With all that shocking ghastly junk. Oh yes, we know it keeps them still, They don't climb out the window sill, They never fight or kick or punch, They leave you free to cook the lunch And wash the dishes in the sink -- But did you ever stop to think, To wonder just exactly what This does to your beloved tot? IT ROTS THE SENSE IN THE HEAD! IT KILLS IMAGINATION DEAD! IT CLOGS AND CLUTTERS UP THE MIND! IT MAKES A CHILD SO DULL AND BLIND HE CAN NO LONGER UNDERSTAND A FANTASY, A FAIRYLAND! HIS BRAIN BECOMES AS SOFT AS CHEESE! HIS POWERS OF THINKING RUST AND FREEZE! HE CANNOT THINK -- HE ONLY SEES! 'All right!' you'll cry. 'All right!' you'll say, 'But if we take the set away, What shall we do to entertain Our darling children? Please explain!' We'll answer this by asking you, 'What used the darling ones to do? 'How used they keep themselves contented Before this monster was invented?' Have you forgotten? Don't you know? We'll say it very loud and slow: THEY ... USED ... TO ... READ! They'd READ and READ, AND READ and READ, and then proceed To READ some more. Great Scott! Gadzooks! One half their lives was reading books! The nursery shelves held books galore! Books cluttered up the nursery floor! And in the bedroom, by the bed, More books were waiting to be read! Such wondrous, fine, fantastic tales Of dragons, gypsies, queens, and whales And treasure isles, and distant shores Where smugglers rowed with muffled oars, And pirates wearing purple pants, And sailing ships and elephants, And cannibals crouching 'round the pot, Stirring away at something hot. (It smells so good, what can it be? Good gracious, it's Penelope.) The younger ones had Beatrix Potter With Mr. Tod, the dirty rotter, And Squirrel Nutkin, Pigling Bland, And Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle and- Just How The Camel Got His Hump, And How the Monkey Lost His Rump, And Mr. Toad, and bless my soul, There's Mr. Rat and Mr. Mole- Oh, books, what books they used to know, Those children living long ago! So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install A lovely bookshelf on the wall. Then fill the shelves with lots of books, Ignoring all the dirty looks, The screams and yells, the bites and kicks, And children hitting you with sticks- Fear not, because we promise you That, in about a week or two Of having nothing else to do, They'll now begin to feel the need Of having something to read. And once they start -- oh boy, oh boy! You watch the slowly growing joy That fills their hearts. They'll grow so keen They'll wonder what they'd ever seen In that ridiculous machine, That nauseating, foul, unclean, Repulsive television screen! And later, each and every kid Will love you more for what you did.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI loved you, and I probably still do,And for a while the feeling may remain...But let my love no longer trouble you,I do not wish to cause you any pain.I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -Made up a love so tender and so trueAs may God grant you to be loved again.Translated by Genia Gurarie, 11/10/95\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t     He clasps the crag with crooked hands;    Close to the sun in lonely lands,    Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.    The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;    He watches from his mountain walls,    And like a thunderbolt he falls.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGod made a beatous gardenWith lovely flowers strown,But one straight, narrow pathwayThat was not overgrown.And to this beauteous gardenHe brought mankind to live,And said: 'To you, my children,These lovely flowers I give.Prune ye my vines and fig trees,With care my flowerets tend,But keep the pathway openYour home is at the end.'Then came another master,Who did not love mankind,And planted on the pathwayGold flowers for them to find.And mankind saw the bright flowers,That, glitt'ring in the sun,Quite hid the thorns of av'riceThat poison blood and bone;And far off many wandered,And when life's night came on,They still were seeking gold flowers,Lost, helpless and alone.O, cease to heed the glamourThat blinds your foolish eyes,Look upward to the glitterOf stars in God's clear skies.Their ways are pure and harmlessAnd will not lead astray,Bid aid your erring footstepsTo keep the narrow way.And when the sun shines brightlyTend flowers that God has givenAnd keep the pathway openThat leads you on to heaven.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA voice said, Look me in the starsAnd tell me truly, men of earth,If all the soul-and-body scarsWere not too much to pay for birth.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough airy roads he wings his instant flightTo purer regions of celestial light;Enlarg'd he sees unnumber'd systems roll,Beneath him sees the universal whole,Planets on planets run their destin'd round,And circling wonders fill the vast profound.Th' ethereal now, and now th' empyreal skiesWith growing splendors strike his wond'ring eyes:The angels view him with delight unknown,Press his soft hand, and seat him on his throne;Then smilling thus: 'To this divine abode,'The seat of saints, of seraphs, and of God,'Thrice welcome thou.'  The raptur'd babe replies,'Thanks to my God, who snatch'd me to the skies,'E'er vice triumphant had possess'd my heart,'E'er yet the tempter had beguil d my heart,'E'er yet on sin's base actions I was bent,'E'er yet I knew temptation's dire intent;'E'er yet the lash for horrid crimes I felt,'E'er vanity had led my way to guilt,'But, soon arriv'd at my celestial goal,'Full glories rush on my expanding soul.'Joyful he spoke: exulting cherubs roundClapt their glad wings, the heav'nly vaults resound.  Say, parents, why this unavailing moan?Why heave your pensive bosoms with the groan?To Charles, the happy subject of my song,A brighter world, and nobler strains belong.Say would you tear him from the realms aboveBy thoughtless wishes, and prepost'rous love?Doth his felicity increase your pain?Or could you welcome to this world againThe heir of bliss? with a superior airMethinks he answers with a smile severe,'Thrones and dominions cannot tempt me there.'  But still you cry, 'Can we the sigh borbear,'And still and still must we not pour the tear?'Our only hope, more dear than vital breath,'Twelve moons revolv'd, becomes the prey of death;'Delightful infant, nightly visions give'Thee to our arms, and we with joy receive,'We fain would clasp the Phantom to our breast,'The Phantom flies, and leaves the soul unblest.'  To yon bright regions let your faith ascend,Prepare to join your dearest infant friendIn pleasures without measure, without end.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was not dying: everybody died. It was not dying: we had died before In the routine crashes-- and our fields Called up the papers, wrote home to our folks, And the rates rose, all because of us. We died on the wrong page of the almanac, Scattered on mountains fifty miles away; Diving on haystacks, fighting with a friend, We blazed up on the lines we never saw. We died like aunts or pets or foreigners. (When we left high school nothing else had died For us to figure we had died like.)   In our new planes, with our new crews, we bombed The ranges by the desert or the shore, Fired at towed targets, waited for our scores-- And turned into replacements and woke up One morning, over England, operational.   It wasn't different: but if we died It was not an accident but a mistake (But an easy one for anyone to make.) We read our mail and counted up our missions-- In bombers named for girls, we burned The cities we had learned about in school-- Till our lives wore out; our bodies lay among The people we had killed and never seen. When we lasted long enough they gave us medals; When we died they said, 'Our casualties were low.'   They said, 'Here are the maps'; we burned the cities.   It was not dying --no, not ever dying; But the night I died I dreamed that I was dead, And the cities said to me: 'Why are you dying? We are satisfied, if you are; but why did I die?'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe talks, turning a sun-stainedCheek to me, his mouth, a darkCavern, where stalactites ofUneven teeth gleam, his rightHand on my knee, while our mindsAre willed to race towards love;But, they only wander, trippingIdly over puddles ofDesire. .... .Can this man withNimble finger-tips unleashNothing more alive than theSkin's lazy hungers? Who canHelp us who have lived so longAnd have failed in love? The heart,An empty cistern, waitingThrough long hours, fills itselfWith coiling snakes of silence. .....I am a freak. It's onlyTo save my face, I flaunt, atTimes, a grand, flamboyant lust.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTime is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy minutes. Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to wait. Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower. We have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chance. We are too poor to be late. And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last. At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; but I find that yet there is time. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with Caesar. The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-For Brutus is an honourable man;So are they all, all honourable men-Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.He hath brought many captives home to RomeWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And, sure, he is an honourable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know.You all did love him once, not without cause:What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,And I must pause till it come back to me.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExpect nothing.

Whole families shopping at night! Aislesfull of husbands! Wives in the avocados, babies in the tomatoes! --- and you,Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among themeats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What pricebananas? Are you my Angel?I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, andfollowed in my imagination by the store detective.We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tastingartichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.Where are we going, Walt Whitman? The doors close in an hour. Which way doesyour beard point tonight?(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the supermarket and feelabsurd.)Will we walk all night through solitary streets? The trees add shade toshade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.Will we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love past blue automobiles indriveways, home to our silent cottage?Ah, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher, what America did youhave when Charon quit poling his ferry and you got out on a smoking bank andstood watching the boat disappear on the black waters of Lethe?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhere had I heard this wind beforeChange like this to a deeper roar? What would it take my standing there for,Holding open a restive door,Looking down hill to a frothy shore?

His smileIs like an infant's - gentle, without guile.Ah, Nature, keep him warm; he may catch cold.The humming insects don't disturb his rest;He sleeps in sunlight, one hand on his breast;At peace.

Souriant commeSourirait un enfant malade, il fait un somme :Nature, berce-le chaudement : il a froid.Les parfums ne font pas frissonner sa narine ;Il dort dans le soleil, la main sur sa poitrine,Tranquille.

SnowdropsAnd candles soothed the bedside; I saw himFor the first time in six weeks.

would be greatly the better forWould be a more restricted employment by the authors of simile andmetaphor.Authors of all races, be they Greeks, Romans, Teutons or Celts,Can't seem just to say that anything is the thing it is but have togo out of their way to say that it is like something else.What does it mean when we are toldThat that Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold?In the first place, George Gordon Byron had enough experienceTo know that it probably wasn't just one Assyrian, it was a lot ofAssyrians.However, as too many arguments are apt to induce apoplexy andthus hinder longevity.We'll let it pass as one Assyrian for the sake of brevity.Now then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts weregleaming in purple and gold,Just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like awold on the fold?In heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophythere are great many things.But I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purpleand gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings.No, no, Lord Byron, before I'll believe that this Assyrian wasactually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof;Did he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big redmouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?Frankly I think it is very unlikely, and all you were entitled to say,at the very most,Was that the Assyrian cohorts came down like a lot of Assyriancohorts about to destroy the Hebrew host.But that wasn't fancy enough for Lord Byron, oh dear me no, hehad to invent a lot of figures of speech and then interpolate them,With the result that whenever you mention Old Testament soldiersto people they say Oh yes, they're the ones that a lot ofwolves dressed up in gold and purple ate them.That's the kind of thing that's being done all the time by poets,from Homer to Tennyson;They're always comparing ladies to lilies and veal to venison,And they always say things like that the snow is a white blanketafter a winter storm.Oh it is, is it, all right then, you sleep under a six-inch blanket ofsnow and I'll sleep under a half-inch blanket of unpoeticalblanket material and we'll see which one keeps warm,And after that maybe you'll begin to comprehend dimlyWhat I mean by too much metaphor and simile.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom fabrication springs the spiral stairup which the wakeful princess climbs to findthe source of blanching light that conjured herto leave her bed of fever and ascenda visionary ladder toward the moonwhose holy blue anoints her injured hand.With finger bandaged where the waspish pinflew from the intricate embroideryand stung according to the witch's plan,she mounts through malice of the needle's eye,trailing her scrupulously simple gownalong bright asterisks by milky way.Colonnades of angels nod her inwhere ancient, infinite, and beautiful,her legendary godmother leans down,spinning a single stubborn thread of woolwhich all the artful wizards cannot crimpto keep the young girl from her crowning goal.Initiated by the lunar lamp,kindling her within a steepled flame,the princess hears the thunder and the pompof squadrons underground abducting himwho is the destination of the cordnow bound around her wrist till she redeemthis miner's boy from goblin bodyguard.Guided only by the tug and twitchof that mercurial strand, the girl goes downthe darkening stair, undoes the palace latchand slips unseen past watchmen on the lawndozing around their silvered sentry box.Across the frosted grass she marks the sheenof thread conducting her to the worn tracksmade by miners up the mountainsideamong the jagged mazes of the rocks.Laboring on the tilt of that steep gradebehind which the declining moon has set,she recalls queer stories her nurse readabout a goblin raid on miner's hutbecause new excavations came too nearthe chambers where their fiendish queen would sit.Hearing a weird cackle from afar,she clutches at the talismanic cordand confronts a cairn of iron ore.Suddenly a brazen song is heardfrom the pragmatic boy confined within,gaily cursing the whole goblin horde.Inviolate in the circle of that skein,looping like faith about her bleeding feet,the princess frees the miner, stone by stone,and leads him home to be her chosen knight.The princess coaxes the incredulous boythrough candid kitchens in the rising sunto seek the staircase by the glare of day.Hand in hand, they scale meridian,clambering up the creaking heights of heatuntil she hears the twittering machinewhich quaintly wove the fabric of her fatebehind the zodiac on attic doorwith abracadabra from the alphabet.Pointing toward the spindle's cryptic whir,she tells the greenhorn miner to bow downand honor the great goddess of the airsuspended aloft within her planet-shine.Laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demandswhy he should kneel before a silly scenewhere pigeons promenade the gable-endsand coo quadrilles about the blighted corein a batch of raveled apple rinds.At his words, the indignant godmothervanishes in a labyrinth of haywhile sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor.O never again will the extravagant strawknit up a gilded fable for the childwho weeps before the desolate tableauof clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWay Down South in Dixie(Break the heart of me)They hung my black young loverTo a cross roads tree.Way Down South in

her hands and she straightened her hair up,Then Isabel quietly ate the bear up.Once in a night as black as pitchIsabel met a wicked old witch.the witch's face was cross and wrinkled,The witch's gums with teeth were sprinkled.Ho, ho, Isabel! the old witch crowed,I'll turn you into an ugly toad!Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry,She showed no rage and she showed no rancor,But she turned the witch into milk and drank her.Isabel met a hideous giant,Isabel continued self reliant.The giant was hairy, the giant was horrid,He had one eye in the middle of his forhead.Good morning, Isabel, the giant said,I'll grind your bones to make my bread.Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She nibled the zwieback that she always fed off,And when it was gone, she cut the giant's head off.Isabel met a troublesome doctor,He punched and he poked till he really shocked her.The doctor's talk was of coughs and chillsAnd the doctor's satchel bulged with pills.The doctor said unto Isabel,Swallow this, it will make you well.Isabel, Isabel, didn't worry,Isabel didn't scream or scurry.She took those pills from the pill concocter,And Isabel calmly cured the doctor.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll out of doors looked darkly in at himThrough the thin frost, almost in separate stars,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.What kept his eyes from giving back the gazeWas the lamp tilted near them in his hand.What kept him from remembering what it wasThat brought him to that creaking room was age.He stood with barrels round him -- at a loss.And having scared the cellar under himIn clomping there, he scared it once againIn clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roarOf trees and crack of branches, common things,But nothing so like beating on a box.A light he was to no one but himselfWhere now he sat, concerned with he knew what,A quiet light, and then not even that.He consigned to the moon, such as she was,So late-arising, to the broken moonAs better than the sun in any caseFor such a charge, his snow upon the roof,His icicles along the wall to keep;And slept. The log that shifted with a joltOnce in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.One aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,A farm, a countryside, or if he can,It's thus he does it of a winter night.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t‘COME hither, my Sparrows,\tMy little arrows.\tIf a tear or a smile\tWill a man beguile,\tIf an amorous delay\t Clouds a sunshiny day,\tIf the step of a foot\tSmites the heart to its root,\t'Tis the marriage-ring…\tMakes each fairy a king.'\t    So a Fairy sung.\tFrom the leaves I sprung;\tHe leap'd from the spray\tTo flee away;\tBut in my hat caught,\t      He soon shall be taught.\tLet him laugh, let him cry,\tHe's my Butterfly;\tFor I've pull'd out the sting\tOf the marriage-ring.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHow do you like to go up in a swing, Up in the air so blue?

No one, no one.I have said it before.No one is sleeping.But if someone grows too much moss on his temples during thenight,open the stage trapdoors so he can see in the moonlightthe lying goblets, and the poison, and the skull of the theaters.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA stranger came to the door at eve,And he spoke the bridegroom fair.He bore a green-white stick in his hand,And, for all burden, care.He asked with the eyes more than the lipsFor a shelter for the night,And he turned and looked at the road afarWithout a window light.The bridegroom came forth into the porchWith, 'Let us look at the sky,And question what of the night to be,Stranger, you and I.'The woodbine leaves littered the yard,The woodbine berries were blue,Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;'Stranger, I wish I knew.'Within, the bride in the dusk aloneBent over the open fire,Her face rose-red with the glowing coalAnd the thought of the heart's desire.The bridegroom looked at the weary road,Yet saw but her within,And wished her heart in a case of goldAnd pinned with a silver pin.The bridegroom thought it little to giveA dole of bread, a purse,A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,Or for the rich a curse;But whether or not a man was askedTo mar the love of twoBy harboring woe in the bridal house,The bridegroom wished he knew.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSlowly, silently, now the moonWalks the night in her silver shoon;This way, and that, she peers, and seesSilver fruit upon silver trees;One by one the casements catchHer beams beneath the silvery thatch;Couched in his kennel, like a log,With paws of silver sleeps the dog;From their shadowy cote the white breasts peepOf doves in silver feathered sleepA harvest mouse goes scampering by,With silver claws, and silver eye;And moveless fish in the water gleam,By silver reeds in a silver stream.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAbout the size of an old-style dollar bill,American or Canadian,mostly the same whites, gray greens, and steel grays-this little painting (a sketch for a larger one?)has never earned any money in its life.Useless and free., it has spent seventy yearsas a minor family relic handed along collaterally to ownerswho looked at it sometimes, or didn't bother to.It must be Nova Scotia; only theredoes one see abled wooden housespainted that awful shade of brown.The other houses, the bits that show, are white.Elm trees., low hills, a thin church steeple-that gray-blue wisp-or is it? In the foregrounda water meadow with some tiny cows,two brushstrokes each, but confidently cows;two minuscule white geese in the blue water,back-to-back,, feeding, and a slanting stick.Up closer, a wild iris, white and yellow,fresh-squiggled from the tube.The air is fresh and cold; cold early springclear as gray glass; a half inch of blue skybelow the steel-gray storm clouds.(They were the artist's specialty.)A specklike bird is flying to the left.Or is it a flyspeck looking like a bird?Heavens, I recognize the place, I know it!It's behind-I can almost remember the farmer's name.His barn backed on that meadow. There it is,titanium white, one dab. The hint of steeple,filaments of brush-hairs, barely there,must be the Presbyterian church.Would that be Miss Gillespie's house?Those particular geese and cowsare naturally before my time.A sketch done in an hour, \"in one breath,\"once taken from a trunk and handed over.Would you like this? I'll Probably neverhave room to hang these things again.Your Uncle George, no, mine, my Uncle George,he'd be your great-uncle, left them all with Motherwhen he went back to England.You know, he was quite famous, an R.A....I never knew him. We both knew this place,apparently, this literal small backwater,looked at it long enough to memorize it,our years apart. How strange. And it's still loved,or its memory is (it must have changed a lot).Our visions coincided-\"visions\" istoo serious a word-our looks, two looks:art \"copying from life\" and life itself,life and the memory of it so compressedthey've turned into each other. Which is which?Life and the memory of it cramped,dim, on a piece of Bristol board,dim, but how live, how touching in detail-the little that we get for free,the little of our earthly trust. Not much.About the size of our abidancealong with theirs: the munching cows,the iris, crisp and shivering, the waterstill standing from spring freshets,the yet-to-be-dismantled elms, the geese.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.At the edge of the universe I liveBeyond the bend of  Time.    I call it ‘home', but it's Hardly the place to be resting in peace of mind.  Swirls of dust, as cold as Death itself, whip my face.    Fear. Wonder.   A feeling of reverential respect andInexplicable wonderment passes through me Any time the light turns into darkness.   Utterly aimless I let the wind flow away Beyond my void hopes and sins At the edge of the universe. _____________________(Published in my Book ''THE CHINESE GARDENS'', Amazon 2015 - copyright Fabrizio Frosini,2015)  _____________________\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAh, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!

With sobs and tearsThe boy came seeking comfort and I sawWhite blisters beaded on his tender skin.We soothed him till his pain was not so raw.At last he offered us a watery grin,And then I took my billhook, honed the bladeAnd went outside and slashed in fury with itTill not a nettle in that fierce paradeStood upright any more.  And then I litA funeral pyre to burn the fallen dead,But in two weeks the busy sun and rainHad called up tall recruits behind the shed:My son would often feel sharp wounds again.Submitted by Andrew Mayers\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWINE comes in at the mouthAnd love comes in at the eye;That's all we shall know for truthBefore we grow old and die.I lift the glass to my mouth,I look at you, and I sigh.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis saltin the salt cellarI once saw in the salt mines.I knowyou won'tbelieve mebutit singssalt sings, the skinof the salt minessingswith a mouth smotheredby the earth.I shivered in thosesolitudeswhen I heardthe voiceofthe salt in the desert.Near Antofagastathe nitrouspamparesounds:abrokenvoice,a mournfulsong.In its cavesthe salt moans, mountainof buried light,translucent cathedral,crystal of the sea, oblivionof the waves.And then on every tablein the world,salt,we see your piquantpowdersprinklingvital lightuponour food.

me,Black as the Pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll.I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFaster than fairies, faster than witches,Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;And charging along like troops in a battleAll through the meadows the horses and cattle:All of the sights of the hill and the plainFly as thick as driving rain;And ever again, in the wink of an eye,Painted stations whistle by.Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,All by himself and gathering brambles;Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;And here is the green for stringing the daisies!Here is a cart runaway in the roadLumping along with man and load;And here is a mill, and there is a river:Each a glimpse and gone forever!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe die, Welcoming Bluebeards to our darkening closets, Stranglers to our outstretched necks,               Stranglers, who neither care nor              care to know that              DEATH IS INTERNAL.We pray, Savoring sweet the teethed lies, Bellying the grounds before alien gods,               Gods, who neither know nor              wish to know that              HELL IS INTERNAL.We love, Rubbing the nakednesses with gloved hands, Inverting our mouths in tongued kisses,               Kisses that neither touch nor              care to touch if              LOVE IS

small and lonely planet Traveling through casual space Past aloof stars, across the way of indifferent suns To a destination where all signs tell us It is possible and imperative that we learn A brave and startling truth And when we come to it To the day of peacemaking When we release our fingers From fists of hostility And allow the pure air to cool our palms When we come to it When the curtain falls on the minstrel show of hate And faces sooted with scorn are scrubbed clean When battlefields and coliseum No longer rake our unique and particular sons and daughters Up with the bruised and bloody grass To lie in identical plots in foreign soil When the rapacious storming of the churches The screaming racket in the temples have ceased When the pennants are waving gaily When the banners of the world tremble Stoutly in the good, clean breeze When we come to it When we let the rifles fall from our shoulders And children dress their dolls in flags of truce When land mines of death have been removed And the aged can walk into evenings of peace When religious ritual is not perfumed By the incense of burning flesh And childhood dreams are not kicked awake By nightmares of abuse When we come to it Then we will confess that not the Pyramids With their stones set in mysterious perfection Nor the Gardens of Babylon Hanging as eternal beauty In our collective memory Not the Grand Canyon Kindled into delicious color By Western sunsets Nor the Danube, flowing its blue soul into Europe Not the sacred peak of Mount Fuji Stretching to the Rising Sun Neither Father Amazon nor Mother Mississippi who, without favor, Nurture all creatures in the depths and on the shores These are not the only wonders of the world When we come to it We, this people, on this minuscule and kithless globe Who reach daily for the bomb, the blade and the dagger Yet who petition in the dark for tokens of peace We, this people on this mote of matter In whose mouths abide cankerous words Which challenge our very existence Yet out of those same mouths Come songs of such exquisite sweetness That the heart falters in its labor And the body is quieted into awe We, this people, on this small and drifting planet Whose hands can strike with such abandon That in a twinkling, life is sapped from the living Yet those same hands can touch with such healing, irresistible tenderness That the haughty neck is happy to bow And the proud back is glad to bend Out of such chaos, of such contradiction We learn that we are neither devils nor divines When we come to it We, this people, on this wayward, floating body Created on this earth, of this earth Have the power to fashion for this earth A climate where every man and every woman Can live freely without sanctimonious piety Without crippling fear When we come to it We must confess that we are the possible We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world That is when, and only when We come to it.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half-light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreams;I have spread my dreams under your feet;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?And the tedding and the spreadingOf the straw for a bedding,And the fleas that tease in the High Pyrenees,And the wine that tasted of tar?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteers(Under the vine of the dark veranda)?Do you remember an Inn, Miranda,Do you remember an Inn?And the cheers and the jeers of the young muleteersWho hadn't got a penny,And who weren't paying any,And the hammer at the doors and the din?And the hip! hop! hap!Of the clapOf the hands to the swirl and the twirlOf the girl gone chancing,Glancing,Dancing,Backing and advancing,Snapping of the clapper to the spinOut and in--And the ting, tong, tang of the guitar!Do you remember an Inn,Miranda?Do you remember an Inn?Never more;Miranda,Never more.Only the high peaks hoar;And Aragon a torrent at the door.No soundIn the walls of the halls where fallsThe treadOf the feet of the dead to the ground,No sound:But the boomOf the far waterfall like doom.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDeath is nothing at all.I have only slipped away to the next room.I am I and you are you.Whatever we were to each other, That, we still are.Call me by my old familiar name.Speak to me in the easy waywhich you always used.Put no difference into your tone.Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.Laugh as we always laughedat the little jokes we enjoyed together.Play, smile, think of me.  Pray for me.Let my name be ever the household wordthat it always was.Let it be spoken without effect.Without the trace of a shadow on it.Life means all that it ever meant.It is the same that it ever was.There is absolute unbroken continuity.Why should I be out of mindbecause I am out of sight? I am but waiting for you.For an interval.Somewhere. Very near.Just around the corner.All is well.Nothing is past; nothing is lost. One brief moment and all will be as it was before only better, infinitely happier and forever we will all be one together with Christ.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder his helmet, up against his pack,After so many days of work and waking,Sleep took him by the brow and laid him back.There, in the happy no-time of his sleeping,Death took him by the heart. There heaved a quakingOf the aborted life within him leaping,Then chest and sleepy arms once more fell slack.And soon the slow, stray blood came creepingFrom the intruding lead, like ants on track.Whether his deeper sleep lie shaded by the shakingOf great wings, and the thoughts that hung the stars,High-pillowed on calm pillows of God's making,Above these clouds, these rains, these sleets of lead,And these winds' scimitars,-Or whether yet his thin and sodden headConfuses more and more with the low mould,His hair being one with the grey grassOf finished fields, and wire-scrags rusty-old,Who knows? Who hopes? Who troubles? Let it pass!He sleeps. He sleeps less tremulous, less cold,Than we who wake, and waking say Alas!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSome clichty folksdon't know the facts,posin' and preenin'and puttin' on acts,stretchin' their backs.They move into condosup over the ranks,pawn their soulsto the local banks.Buying big carsthey can't afford,ridin' around townactin' bored.If they want to learn how to live life rightthey ought to study me on Saturday night.My job at the plantain't the biggest bet,but I pay my billsand stay out of debt.I get my hair donefor my own self's sake,so I don't have to pickand I don't have to rake.Take the church money outand head cross townto my friend girl's housewhere we plan our round.We meet our men and go to a jointwhere the music is blueand to the point.Folks write about me.They just can't seehow I work all weekat the factory.Then get spruced upand laugh and danceAnd turn away from worrywith sassy glance.They accuse me of livin'from day to day,but who are they kiddin'?So are they.My life ain't heavenbut it sure ain't hell.I'm not on topbut I call it swellif I'm able to workand get paid rightand have the luck to be Blackon a Saturday night.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tO Nature!

\"She is warmer than Dian:She rolls through an ether of sighs -She revels in a region of sighs:She has seen that the tears are not dry onThese cheeks, where the worm never dies,And has come past the stars of the LionTo point us the path to the skies -To the Lethean peace of the skies -Come up, in despite of the Lion,To shine on us with her bright eyes -Come up through the lair of the Lion,With love in her luminous eyes.\"But Psyche, uplifting her finger,Said - \"Sadly this star I mistrust -Her pallor I strangely mistrust: -Oh, hasten! - oh, let us not linger!Oh, fly! - let us fly! - for we must.\"In terror she spoke, letting sink herWings until they trailed in the dust -In agony sobbed, letting sink herPlumes till they trailed in the dust -Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.I replied - \"This is nothing but dreaming:Let us on by this tremulous light!Let us bathe in this crystalline light!Its Sybilic splendor is beamingWith Hope and in Beauty to-night! -See! - it flickers up the sky through the night!Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,And be sure it will lead us aright -We safely may trust to a gleaming,That cannot but guide us aright,Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,And tempted her out of her gloom -And conquered her scruples and gloom;And we passed to the end of the vista,But were stopped by the door of a tomb -By the door of a legended tomb;And I said - \"What is written, sweet sister,On the door of this legended tomb?\"She replied - \"Ulalume - Ulalume -‘Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"Then my heart it grew ashen and soberAs the leaves that were crisped and sere -As the leaves that were withering and sere,And I cried - \"It was surely OctoberOn this very night of last yearThat I journeyed - I journeyed down here -That I brought a dread burden down here!On this night of all nights in the year,Ah, what demon has tempted me here?Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber -This misty mid region of Weir -Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber, -This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.Hush, hush! tread softly! hush, hush my dear!All the house is asleep, but we know very wellThat the jealous, the jealous old bald-pate may hear.Tho' you've padded his night-cap -- O sweet Isabel!Tho' your feet are more light than a Fairy's feet,Who dances on bubbles where brooklets meet,--Hush, hush! soft tiptoe! hush, hush my dear!For less than a nothing the jealous can hear.2.No leaf doth tremble, no ripple is thereOn the river, -- all's still, and the night's sleepy eyeCloses up, and forgets all its Lethean care,Charm'd to death by the drone of the humming May-fly;And the Moon, whether prudish or complaisant,Hath fled to her bower, well knowing I wantNo light in the dusk, no torch in the gloom,But my Isabel's eyes, and her lips pulp'd with bloom.3.Lift the latch! ah gently! ah tenderly -- sweet!We are dead if that latchet gives one little chink!Well done -- now those lips, and a flowery seat --The old man may sleep, and the planets may wink;The shut rose shall dream of our loves, and awakeFull blown, and such warmth for the morning's take;The stock-dove shall hatch her soft brace and shall coo,While I kiss to the melody, aching all through!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen it hurts so bad, why does it feel so good? I wish this all made sense, I wish I understood.Not having you here with me is tearing me up inside, but I can't stop thinking about you no matter how hard I try.You know how I feel about you, and I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you, but it's so hard to do when I can't even be next to you.Why does it got to be so complicated? Loving you feels so right, but at the same time, knowing I can't have you keeps me awake at night.I just want this to be simple, I just want you here with me, to look into your eyes, be held in your arms...then I'd truly be happy.Right now this distance between us is out of our control, but I'm still hoping one day soon, I'll get what I'm wishing for.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOnce, when I was young and true,  Someone left me sad-Broke my brittle heart in two;  And that is very bad.Love is for unlucky folk,  Love is but a curse.Once there was a heart I broke;  And that, I think, is worse.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOcean, if you were to give, a measure, a ferment, a fruitof your gifts and destructions, into my hand,I would choose your far-off repose, your contour of steel,your vigilant spaces of air and darkness,and the power of your white tongue,that shatters and overthrows columns,breaking them down to your proper purity.Not the final breaker, heavy with brine,that thunders onshore, and createsthe silence of sand, that encircles the world,but the inner spaces of force,the naked power of the waters,the immoveable solitude, brimming with lives.It is Time perhaps, or the vessel filledwith all motion, pure Oneness,that death cannot touch, the visceral greenof consuming totality.Only a salt kiss remains of the drowned arm,that lifts a spray: a humid scent,of the damp flower, is left,from the bodies of men. Your energiesform, in a trickle that is not spent,form, in retreat into silence.The falling wave,arch of identity, shattering feathers,is only spume when it clears, and returns to its source, unconsumed.Your whole force heads for its origin.The husks that your load threshes,are only the crushed, plundered, deliveries,that your act of abundance expelled,all those that take life from your branches.Your form extends beyond breakers,vibrant, and rhythmic, like the chest, cloakinga single being, and its breathings,that lift into the content of light,plains raised above waves,forming the naked surface of earth.You fill your true self with your substance.You overflow curve with silence.The vessel trembles with your salt and sweetness,the universal cavern of waters,and nothing is lost from you, as it isfrom the desolate crater, or the bay of a hill,those empty heights, signs, scars,guarding the wounded air.Your petals throbbing against the Earth,trembling your submarine harvests,your menace thickening the smooth swell,with pulsations and swarming of schools,and only the thread of the net raisesthe dead lightning of fish-scale,one wounded millimetre, in the spaceof your crystal completeness.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth. I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain. I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue. A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence. But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat, Of loveliness; When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally; And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one; In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly. ______ Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMaking the best of what we hadWas our first deal. Pity it was notEnough. Just aPre-destined route.Our place is now deserted. WretchedLike an unfinished song. It's the sameFor both of us.Whom do you belong to? And I?

I said it too: 'Yes, for her name.'She nodded. So we're sure there's no mistake.I don't know what she wanted it to mean,But it seems like some word she left to bid youBe a good girl—be like a maple tree.How like a maple tree's for us to guess.Or for a little girl to guess sometime.Not now—at least I shouldn't try too hard now.By and by I will tell you all I knowAbout the different trees, and something, too,About your mother that perhaps may help.'Dangerous self-arousing words to sow.Luckily all she wanted of her name thenWas to rebuke her teacher with it next day,And give the teacher a scare as from her father.Anything further had been wasted on her,Or so he tried to think to avoid blame.She would forget it. She all but forgot it.What he sowed with her slept so long a sleep,And came so near death in the dark of years,That when it woke and came to life againThe flower was different from the parent seed.It carne back vaguely at the glass one day,As she stood saying her name over aloud,Striking it gently across her lowered eyesTo make it go well with the way she looked.What was it about her name? Its strangeness layIn having too much meaning. Other names,As Lesley, Carol, Irma, Marjorie,Signified nothing. Rose could have a meaning,But hadn't as it went. (She knew a Rose.)This difference from other names it wasMade people notice it—and notice her.(They either noticed it, or got it wrong.)Her problem was to find out what it askedIn dress or manner of the girl who bore it.If she could form some notion of her mother—What she bad thought was lovely, and what good.This was her mother's childhood home;The house one story high in front, three storiesOn the end it presented to the road.(The arrangement made a pleasant sunny cellar.)Her mother's bedroom was her father's still,Where she could watch her mother's picture fading.Once she found for a bookmark in the BibleA maple leaf she thought must have been laidIn wait for her there. She read every wordOf the two pages it was pressed between,As if it was her mother speaking to her.But forgot to put the leaf back in closingAnd lost the place never to read again.She was sure, though, there had been nothing in it.So she looked for herself, as everyoneLooks for himself, more or less outwardly.And her self-seeking, fitful though it was,May still have been what led her on to read,And think a little, and get some city schooling.She learned shorthand, whatever shorthand mayHave had to do with it- she sometimes wondered.So, till she found herself in a strange placeFor the name Maple to have brought her to,Taking dictation on a paper padAnd, in the pauses when she raised her eyes,Watching out of a nineteenth story windowAn airship laboring with unshiplike motionAnd a vague all-disturbing roar above the riverBeyond the highest city built with hands.Someone was saying in such natural tonesShe almost wrote the words down on her knee,'Do you know you remind me of a tree- A maple tree?''Because my name is Maple?''Isn't it Mabel? I thought it was Mabel.''No doubt you've heard the office call me Mabel.I have to let them call me what they like.'They were both stirred that he should have divinedWithout the name her personal mystery.It made it seem as if there must be somethingShe must have missed herself. So they were married,And took the fancy home with them to live by.They went on pilgrimage once to her father's(The house one story high in front, three storiesOn the side it presented to the road)To see if there was not some special treeShe might have overlooked. They could find none,Not so much as a single tree for shade,Let alone grove of trees for sugar orchard.She told him of the bookmark maple leafIn the big Bible, and all she rememberedof the place marked with it—'Wave offering,Something about wave offering, it said.''You've never asked your father outright, have you?''I have, and been Put off sometime, I think.'(This was her faded memory of the wayOnce long ago her father had put himself off.)'Because no telling but it may have beenSomething between your father and your motherNot meant for us at all.''Not meant for me?Where would the fairness be in giving meA name to carry for life and never knowThe secret of?''And then it may have beenSomething a father couldn't tell a daughterAs well as could a mother. And againIt may have been their one lapse into fancy'Twould be too bad to make him sorry forBy bringing it up to him when be was too old.Your father feels us round him with our questing,And holds us off unnecessarily,As if he didn't know what little thingMight lead us on to a discovery.It was as personal as be could beAbout the way he saw it was with youTo say your mother, bad she lived, would beAs far again as from being born to bearing.''Just one look more with what you say in mind,And I give up'; which last look came to nothing.But though they now gave up the search forever,They clung to what one had seen in the otherBy inspiration. It proved there was something.They kept their thoughts away from when the maplesStood uniform in buckets, and the steamOf sap and snow rolled off the sugarhouse.When they made her related to the maples,It was the tree the autumn fire ran throughAnd swept of leathern leaves, but left the barkUnscorched, unblackened, even, by any smoke.They always took their holidays in autumn.Once they came on a maple in a glade,Standing alone with smooth arms lifted up,And every leaf of foliage she'd wornLaid scarlet and pale pink about her feet.But its age kept them from considering this one.Twenty-five years ago at Maple's namingIt hardly could have been a two-leaved seedlingThe next cow might have licked up out at pasture.Could it have been another maple like it?They hovered for a moment near discovery,Figurative enough to see the symbol,But lacking faith in anything to meanThe same at different times to different people.Perhaps a filial diffidence partly kept themFrom thinking it could be a thing so bridal.And anyway it came too late for Maple.She used her hands to cover up her eyes.'We would not see the secret if we could now:We are not looking for it any more.'Thus had a name with meaning, given in death,Made a girl's marriage, and ruled in her life.No matter that the meaning was not clear.A name with meaning could bring up a child,Taking the child out of the parents' hands.Better a meaningless name, I should say,As leaving more to nature and happy chance.Name children some names and see what you do.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBeautiful is the 'thank you'Wrapped with gratitude, Offered to peace prone peopleWho go out of their way To nurse shrapnel scalded victimsAmidst napalm drugged air, Carrying their humanity, quietlyAnd humbly, in our Blood stained, greed diseased, Hate eaten world.Beautiful is the momentwhen sunlit world fades away And with it mind made mirror While look inward drawn, sight insight led, Consciousness expands endlessly.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI WHISPERED, 'I am too young,'And then, 'I am old enough';Wherefore I threw a pennyTo find out if I might love.'Go and love, go and love, young man,If the lady be young and fair.'Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,I am looped in the loops of her hair.O love is the crooked thing,There is nobody wise enoughTo find out all that is in it,For he would be thinking of loveTill the stars had run awayAnd the shadows eaten the moon.Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,One cannot begin it too soon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI caught a tremendous fishand held him beside the boathalf out of water, with my hookfast in a corner of his mouth.He didn't fight.He hadn't fought at all.He hung a grunting weight,battered and venerableand homely. Here and therehis brown skin hung in stripslike ancient wallpaper,and its pattern of darker brownwas like wallpaper:shapes like full-blown rosesstained and lost through age.He was speckled with barnacles,fine rosettes of lime,and infestedwith tiny white sea-lice,and underneath two or threerags of green weed hung down.While his gills were breathing inthe terrible oxygen- the frightening gills,fresh and crisp with blood,that can cut so badly- I thought of the coarse white fleshpacked in like feathers,the big bones and the little bones,the dramatic reds and blacksof his shiny entrails,and the pink swim-bladderlike a big peony.I looked into his eyeswhich were far larger than minebut shallower, and yellowed,the irises backed and packedwith tarnished tinfoilseen through the lensesof old scratched isinglass.They shifted a little, but notto return my stare.- It was more like the tippingof an object toward the light.I admired his sullen face,the mechanism of his jaw,and then I sawthat from his lower lip- if you could call it a lipgrim, wet, and weaponlike,hung five old pieces of fish-line,or four and a wire leaderwith the swivel still attached,with all their five big hooksgrown firmly in his mouth.A green line, frayed at the endwhere he broke it, two heavier lines,and a fine black threadstill crimped from the strain and snapwhen it broke and he got away.Like medals with their ribbonsfrayed and wavering,a five-haired beard of wisdomtrailing from his aching jaw.I stared and staredand victory filled upthe little rented boat,from the pool of bilgewhere oil had spread a rainbowaround the rusted engineto the bailer rusted orange,the sun-cracked thwarts,the oarlocks on their strings,the gunnels- until everythingwas rainbow, rainbow, rainbow! And I let the fish go.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI had a little nut-tree,Nothing would it bear.I searched in all its branches,But not a nut was there.'Oh, little tree,' I begged,'Give me just a few.'The little tree looked down at meAnd whispered, 'Nuts to you.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t101Will there really be a \"Morning\"?Is there such a thing as \"Day\"?Could I see it from the mountainsIf I were as tall as they?Has it feet like Water lilies?Has it feathers like a Bird?Is it brought from famous countriesOf which I have never heard?Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor!Oh some Wise Men from the skies!Please to tell a little PilgrimWhere the place called \"Morning\" lies!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Dear friends, we surely all agreeThere's almost nothing worse to seeThan some repulsive little bumWho's always chewing chewing gum.(It's very near as bad as thoseWho sit around and pick the nose).So please believe us when we sayThat chewing gum will never pay;This sticky habit's bound to sendThe chewer to a sticky end.Did any of you ever knowA person called Miss Bigelow?This dreadful woman saw no wrongIn chewing, chewing all day long.She chewed while bathing in the tub,She chewed while dancing at her club,She chewed in church and on the bus;It really was quite ludicrous!And when she couldn't find her gum,She'd chew up the linoleum,Or anything that happened near–A pair of boots, the postman's ear,Or other people's underclothes,And once she chewed her boy friend's nose.She went on chewing till, at last,Her chewing muscles grew so vastThat from her face her giant chinStuck out just like a violin.For years and years she chewed away,Consuming fifty packs a day,Until one summer's eve, alas,A horrid business came to pass.Miss Bigelow went late to bed,For half an hour she lay and read,Chewing and chewing all the whileLike some great clockwork crocodile.At last, she put her gum awayUpon a special little tray,And settled back and went to sleep–(She managed this by counting sheep).But now, how strange! Although she slept,Those massive jaws of hers still keptOn chewing, chewing through the night,Even with nothing there to bite.They were, you see, in such a grooveThey positively had to move.And very grim it was to hearIn pitchy darkness, loud and clear,This sleeping woman's great big trapOpening and shutting, snap–snap–snap!Faster and faster, chop–chop–chop,The noise went on, it wouldn't stop.Until at last her jaws decideTo pause and open extra wide,And with the most tremendous chewThey bit the lady's tongue in two.Thereafter, just from chewing gum,Miss Bigelow was always dumb,And spent her life shut up in someDisgusting sanatorium.And that is why we'll try so hardTo save Miss Violet BeauregardFrom suffering an equal fate.She's still quite young. It's not too late,Provided she survives the cure.We hope she does. We can't be sure.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t'Veruca Salt, the little brute,Has just gone down the garbage chute,(And as we very rightly thoughtThat in a case like this we oughtTo see the thing completely through,We've polished off her parents, too.)Down goes Veruca! Down the drain!And here, perhaps, we should explainThat she will meet, as she descends,A rather different set of friendsTo those that she has left behind–These won't be nearly so refined.A fish head, for example, cutThis morning from a halibut.'Hello! Good morning! How d'you do?How nice to meet you! How are you?'And then a little further downA mass of others gather round:A bacon rind, some rancid lard,A loaf of bread gone stale and hard,A steak that nobody could chew,An oyster from an oyster stew,Some liverwurst so old and grayOne smelled it from a mile away,A rotten nut, a reeky pear,A thing the cat left on the stair,And lots of other things as well,Each with a rather horrid smell.These are Veruca's new found friendsThat she will meet as she descends,And this is the price she has to payFor going so very far astray.But now, my dears, we think you mightBe wondering–is it really rightThat every single bit of blameAnd all the scolding and the shameShould fall upon Veruca Salt?Is she the only one at fault?For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,A girl can't spoil herself, you know.Who spoiled her, then? Ah, who indeed?Who pandered to her every need?Who turned her into such a brat?Who are the culprits? Who did that?Alas! You needen't look so farTo find out who these sinners are.They are (and this is very sad)Her loving parents, MUM and DAD.And that is why we're glad they fellInto the garbage chute as well.'\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tYou and your whole race.Look down upon the town in which you liveAnd be ashamed.Look down upon white folks   And upon yourselves   And be ashamedThat such supine poverty exists there,That such stupid ignorance breeds children thereBehind such humble shelters of despair—That you yourselves have not the sense to careNor the manhood to stand up and sayI dare you to come one step nearer, evil world,With your hands of greed seeking to touch my throat, I dare you to come one step nearer me:                        When you can say that                        you will be free!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA strong woman works out every day, Pride in her appearance she portrays, But a woman of strength kneels to pray, Her soul in shape, God leading the way. A strong woman claims she isn't afraid of anything, Looking forward to challenges each day will bring, Women of strength show courage in the midst of fear, Declaring triumph through faith because God is near. Strong women won't let anyone get the best of them, So skilled in defenses even if they have to pretend, Yet a woman of strength gives her best to everyone, And even on a cloud filled day still bright as the sun. A strong woman relies on the physical attributes making her tough, In her search for power and money she will never have enough, A woman of strength understands that it's not about material stuff, Knowing that before becoming a diamond first she'll be in the rough. A strong woman sometimes disguises her feelings shadowed by clouds, Unhinged when challenged on her policy becoming boisterous and loud, A woman of strength concerns herself not with judgment from others, And will not let business interfere with commitments as a wife and mother. A strong woman is easily impatient back and forth she will begin to pace, Counting on her holier than thou attitude instead of depending on faith, A woman of strength is assured trust in God will always carry her through, And at the Creator's appointed time she'll receive all that is justly due. A strong woman makes mistakes and avoids the same for tomorrow, Refusing to take time looking back with reverence and Godly sorrow, The woman of strength realizes life's mistakes no matter how slim, While thanking God for the blessings as she capitalizes on them. A strong woman walks head first with no doubt in her mind, No matter what, she'll not make this mistake a second time, But a woman of strength knows God will catch her when she falls, So when a situation arises again, she's not afraid to answer the call. A strong woman wears the look of confidence on her face, Always doing whatever it takes to finish, seeking only first place, The woman of strength competes with an emotional sense of grace, Understanding it's more important to run a Holy Spirit filled race. A strong woman has faith that for the journey she'll have enough, No matter how uneven the terrain or roads being rocky and rough, A woman of strength knows it's in the journey she will become strong, And the love of God is forever with her, no matter how difficult or long. A strong woman when uninformed thinks that she is being mistreated, In the end her physical attributes fail causing doubt to become seeded, A woman of strength will compromise as a little give and take is needed, Why? Because a lesson not learned the first time is soon to be repeated. Ladies start everyday on your knees with supplication & prayer, Trust and believe that God will always get you from here to there, And should your giant steps seem to be moving only inch by inch, The journey is not as A Strong Woman but A Woman Of Strength. Realize his-story is not the preverbal or only meaning of the word history, Read the poem titled, 'Women Preachers & Pastors In The Ministry? ' This male chauvinistic attitude's deceitfully titled, 'The Same Old Song, ' No wonder society thinks a woman can't compete & this is totally wrong. Difference between farther & further,1 is distance,1 is to understand, Where Motherhood is instinctive however it has to be learned by man, A woman carries a life form up to & maybe more than 9 months long, Man can't stand to be with a crying for baby 2 hours and he is strong? It is thousands of years later, man still cries, 'first the woman was deceived, 'As Adam looked at God and said, 'it was that woman you gave me' oh Eve? It always happens that when things go wrong we are quick to pass the blame? Sin didn't manifest till Adam ate the fruit as well but he put it on Eve's name.Every woman is a catalyst for any little girl to become the same, So the question is what will be the consequences from her name? Strong relays an outward appearance yet under pressure it cracks, And only through strength will she be able to withstand the attack.Girls beware, because the road traveled is both winding and long, And for this very reason you will surely have to more than strong, This should inform you that an arduous trek is measured in length, The main reason it takes intestinal fortitude only found in strength.Now for an excellent example relaying exactly what we mean, The United States Marine Corps, 'Female Engagement Team, 'Women in Afghanistan not in rear support yet on the front line, Not so much physically strong as through strength in the mind.Isn't it amazing disciples from miraculous powers were big and strong, Peter cut off a servant's ear but denied Christ 3 times it didn't last long, Yet two Mary's and Salome the weaker sex faithfully stood by at length, Face to face with adversity you will only pass through fire with strength.Blacks sat in the back of the bus for years although it was wrong, Now imagine how many men complied who were big and Strong, But, it was a female, Rosa Parks, who would not budge one inch, Yet another example of what it means for women to have Strength.Certain things capture your eye but pursue only those that capture the heart, Although an, 'Ancient Indian Proverb' yet Solomon gave the verse its start, Likewise, don't seek after frivols material things that only make you Strong, For Strength is the seed of eternal roots to remain even after you're gone.The association of motherhood is something truly unique, And only through inner Strength can you reach your peak, As the Strongest will tire from repetitions they must repeat, Because the latter without proper rest is destined to be weak.Imagine how tough women have to be not just bearing and raising their child, While at the same time many have to control their spouse from running wild, A single or married mom with a tight knit family that's united for any length, Not so much from a Strong Woman as it is through, 'A Woman Of Strength.' With all the aforementioned qualifications it is a mystery, Why many believe women should not preach in the ministry, Birth, feed, raise, clothe and impact men with knowledge, Of a multitude of wisdom they'll never receive in college.This poetic tribute is a, 'Shout-Out' to any woman everywhere, Seemingly impossible circumstances faced head on the scare, By the armor of faith fear of the unknown shall not make a dent, They are withstanding not by outward Strong but inner Strength.w/Dee Cheeks\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the milky way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed- and gazed- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you turn the cornerAnd you run into yourselfThen you know that you have turnedAll the corners that are left\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen we two parted  In silence and tears, Half broken-hearted  To sever for years, Pale grew thy cheek and cold,  Colder thy kiss; Truly that hour foretold  Sorrow to this. The dew of the morning  Sunk chill on my brow-- It felt like the warning  Of what I feel now. Thy vows are all broken,  And light is thy fame; I hear thy name spoken,  And share in its shame. They name thee before me,  A knell to mine ear; A shrudder comes o'er me--  Why wert thou so dear? They know not I knew thee,  Who knew thee so well-- Long, long I shall rue thee,  Too deeply to tell.

I cannot rest from travel; I will drink Life to the lees.  All times I have enjoy'd Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades Vext the dim sea.  I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known,-- cities of men And manners, climates, councils, governments, Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,-- And drunk delight of battle with my peers, Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. I am a part of all that I have met; Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades For ever and for ever when I move. How dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! As tho' to breathe were life!  Life piled on life Were all too little, and of one to me Little remains; but every hour is saved >From that eternal silence, something more, A bringer of new things; and vile it were For some three suns to store and hoard myself, And this gray spirit yearning in desire To follow knowledge like a sinking star, Beyond the utmost bound of human thought. This is my son, mine own Telemachus, to whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,-- Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill This labor, by slow prudence to make mild A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees Subdue them to the useful and the good. Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere Of common duties, decent not to fail In offices of tenderness, and pay Meet adoration to my household gods, When I am gone.  He works his work, I mine. There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail; There gloom the dark, broad seas.  My mariners, Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,-- That ever with a frolic welcome took The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed Free hearts, free foreheads,-- you and I are old; Old age hath yet his honor and his toil. Death closes all; but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks; The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep Moans round with many voices.  Come, my friends. 'T is not too late to seek a newer world. Push off, and sitting well in order smite The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths Of all the western stars, until I die. It may be that the gulfs will wash us down; It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, And see the great Achilles, whom we knew. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,-- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRemember me when I am gone away,         Gone far away into the silent land;         When you can no more hold me by the hand,     Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.     Remember me when no more day by day         You tell me of our future that you plann'd:         Only remember me; you understand     It will be late to counsel then or pray.     Yet if you should forget me for a while       And afterwards remember, do not grieve:       For if the darkness and corruption leave       A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,   Better by far you should forget and smile       Than that you should remember and be sad.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t897How fortunate the Grave—All Prizes to obtain—Successful certain, if at last,First Suitor not in vain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRoses are red Violets are blueI've never found someone as patientAs youRoses are redViolets are blueIf you get lostThen I'll look for you Roses are red Violets are blueYou know I'm always sorryWhen I hurt youRoses are red Violets are blueIf I could Id turn back to when i first kissed youRoses are redViolets are blueIf you don't believe meThen what else can I do Roses are red Violets are blueBaby no one knows me As much as youRoses are red Violets are blueBelieve I'll do anythingTo get next to youRoses are red Violets are blueTell me you still love me And I'll run to you Roses are red Violets are blueYou might not knowBut I love you Roses are redViolets are blueThe stars shine brightBut not as bright as you do Roses are redViolets are blue If I could pick anyoneI would pick youRoses are red Violets are blueThe first day I saw you That's when I knewRoses are red Violets are blueNo one will ever love youAs much as I do Roses are red violets are blue Even if you get me mad I'll still be in love with you Roses are red Violets are blueMy heart skips a beat When I'm laying next to youRoses are red Violets are blue If you love me Then show me that that love is true\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSecurely sunning in a forest glade, A mild, well-meaning snakeApproved the adaptations he had madeFor safety’s sake.He liked the skin he had—Its mottled camouflage, its look of mail,And was content that he had thought to addA rattling tail.The tail was not for drumming up a fight;No, nothing of the sort.And he would only use his poisoned biteAs last resort.A peasant now drew near,Collecting wood; the snake, observing this,Expressed concern by uttering a clearBut civil hiss.The simple churl, his nerves at once unstrung, Mistook the other’s toneAnd dashed his brains out with a deftly-flungPre-emptive stone.MoralSecurity, alas, can giveA threatening impression;Too much defense-initiativeCan prompt aggression.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThat Justice is a blind goddessIs a thing to which we black are wise:Her bandage hides two festering soresThat once perhaps were eyes.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was too lonely for her there,And too wild,And since there were but two of them,And no child. And work was little in the house,She was free,And followed where he furrowed field,Or felled log. She rested on a log and tossedThe fresh chips,With a song only to herselfOn her lips. And once she went to break a boughOf black alder.She strayed so far she scarcely heardWhen he called her - And didn't answer - didn't speak -Or return.She stood, and then she ran and hidIn the fern. He never found her, though he lookedEverywhere,And he asked at her mother's houseWas she there. Sudden and swift and light as thatThe ties gave,And he learned of finalitiesBesides the grave.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe, unaccustomed to courageexiles from delightlive coiled in shells of lonelinessuntil love leaves its high holy templeand comes into our sightto liberate us into life.Love arrivesand in its train come ecstasiesold memories of pleasureancient histories of pain.Yet if we are bold,love strikes away the chains of fearfrom our souls.We are weaned from our timidityIn the flush of love's lightwe dare be braveAnd suddenly we seethat love costs all we areand will ever be.Yet it is only lovewhich sets us free.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNow Let's look for birds! The tall iron branches in the forest, The dense fertility on the ground. The world is wet. A dewdrop or raindrop shines, a diminutive star among the leaves. The morning time mother earth is cool. The air is like a river which shakes the silence. It smells of rosemary, of space and roots. Overhead, a crazy song. It's a bird. How out of its throat smaller than a finger can there fall the waters of its song? Luminous ease! Invisible power torrent of music in the leaves. Sacred conversations! Clean and fresh washed is this day resounding like a green dulcimer. I bury my shoes in the mud, jump over rivulets. A thorn bites me and a gust of air like a crystal wave splits up inside my chest. Where are the birds? Maybe it was that rustling in the foliage or that fleeting pellet of brown velvet or that displaced perfume? That leaf that let loose cinnamon smell - was that a bird? That dust from an irritated magnolia or that fruit which fell with a thump - was that a flight? Oh, invisible little critters birds of the devil with their ringing with their useless feathers. I only want to caress them, to see them resplendent. I don't want to see under glass the embalmed lightning. I want to see them living. I want to touch their gloves of real hide, which they never forget in the branches and to converse with them sitting on my shoulders although they may leave me like certain statues undeservedly whitewashed. Impossible. You can't touch them. You can hear them like a heavenly rustle or movement. They converse with precision. They repeat their observations. They brag of how much they do. They comment on everything that exists. They learn certain sciences like hydrography. and by a sure science they know where there are harvests of grain\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI want to sleep the dream of the apples,to withdraw from the tumult of cemetries.I want to sleep the dream of that childwho wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.I don't want to hear again that the dead do not lose their blood,that the putrid mouth goes on asking for water.I don't want to learn of the tortures of the grass,nor of the moon with a serpent's mouththat labors before dawn.I want to sleep awhile,awhile, a minute, a century;but all must know that I have not died;that there is a stable of gold in my lips;that I am the small friend of the West wing;that I am the intense shadows of my tears.Cover me at dawn with a veil,because dawn will throw fistfuls of ants at me,and wet with hard water my shoesso that the pincers of the scorpion slide.For I want to sleep the dream of the apples,to learn a lament that will cleanse me to earth;for I want to live with that dark childwho wanted to cut his heart on the high seas.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDawn in New York hasfour columns of mireand a hurricane of black pigeonssplashing in the putrid waters.Dawn in New York groanson enormous fire escapessearching between the anglesfor spikenards of drafted anguish.Dawn arrives and no one receives it in his mouthbecause morning and hope are impossible there:sometimes the furious swarming coinspenetrate like drills and devour abandoned children.Those who go out early know in their bonesthere will be no paradise or loves that bloom and die:they know they will be mired in numbers and laws,in mindless games, in fruitless labors.The light is buried under chains and noisesin the impudent challenge of rootless science.And crowds stagger sleeplessly through the boroughsas if they had just escaped a shipwreck of blood.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlone at the beachwith hundreds surrounding meCalm asserts itselfCruise ships crawl seawardsStarfish grapple tiny fryGulls circle aboveSun rays caress kelpIncoming waves unsettleThe tide comes closerThe old crab trap sinksNew sailboats disturb bitternsTime to face traffic\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI thought that my voyage had come to its end at the last limit of my power,---that the path before me was closed, that provisions were exhausted and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity. But I find that thy will knows no end in me. And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore and more frequently the edgesof me dissolve and I becomea wish to assimilate the world, includingyou, if possible through the skinlike a cool plant's tricks with oxygenand live by a harmless green burning.I would not consumeyou or everfinish, you would still be theresurrounding me, completeas the air.Unfortunately I don't have leaves.Instead I have eyesand teeth and other non-greenthings which rule out osmosis.So be careful, I mean it,I give you fair warning:This kind of hunger drawseverything into its ownspace; nor can wetalk it all over, have a calmrational discussion.There is no reason for this, onlya starved dog's logic about bones.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI met a traveller from an antique landWho said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert.

Then her face was bowed.Quietly the Brother Officer went out.He'd told the poor old dear some gallant liesThat she would nourish all her days, no doubt.For while he coughed and mumbled, her weak eyesHad shone with gentle triumph, brimmed with joy,Because he'd been so brave, her glorious boy.He thought how 'Jack', cold-footed, useless swine,Had panicked down the trench that night the mineWent up at Wicked Corner; how he'd tried To get sent home, and how, at last, he died,Blown to small bits. And no one seemed to care Except that lonely woman with white hair.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSpades take up leavesNo better than spoons,And bags full of leavesAre light as balloons.I make a great noiseOf rustling all dayLike rabbit and deerRunning away.But the mountains I raiseElude my embrace,Flowing over my armsAnd into my face.I may load and unloadAgain and againTill I fill the whole shed,And what have I then?Next to nothing for weight,And since they grew dullerFrom contact with earth,Next to nothing for color.Next to nothing for use.But a crop is a crop,And who's to say whereThe harvest shall stop?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWho can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dewCover it in chocolate and a miracle or twoThe candy man, the candy man canThe candy man can 'cause he mixes it with loveAnd makes the world taste goodWho can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sighSoak it in the sun and make a strawberry–lemon pieThe candy man?The candy man, the candy man canThe candy man can 'cause he mixes it with loveAnd makes the world taste goodWilly Wonka makes everything he bakesSatisfying and deliciousTalk about your childhood wishesYou can even eat the dishesWho can take tomorrow, dip it in a dreamSeparate the sorrow and collect up all the creamThe candy man, Willy Wonka can, the candy man canThe candy man can 'cause he mixes it with loveAnd makes the world taste goodAnd the world tastes good'Cause the candy man thinks it should\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEspecially when the October windWith frosty fingers punishes my hair,Caught by the crabbing sun I walk on fireAnd cast a shadow crab upon the land,By the sea's side, hearing the noise of birds,Hearing the raven cough in winter sticks,My busy heart who shudders as she talksSheds the syllabic blood and drains her words.Shut, too, in a tower of words, I markOn the horizon walking like the treesThe wordy shapes of women, and the rowsOf the star-gestured children in the park.Some let me make you of the vowelled beeches,Some of the oaken voices, from the rootsOf many a thorny shire tell you notes,Some let me make you of the water's speeches.Behind a pot of ferns the wagging clockTells me the hour's word, the neural meaningFlies on the shafted disk, declaims the morningAnd tells the windy weather in the cock.Some let me make you of the meadow's signs;The signal grass that tells me all I knowBreaks with the wormy winter through the eye.Some let me tell you of the raven's sins.Especially when the October wind(Some let me make you of autumnal spells,The spider-tongued, and the loud hill of Wales)With fists of turnips punishes the land,Some let me make you of the heartless words.The heart is drained that, spelling in the scurryOf chemic blood, warned of the coming fury.By the sea's side hear the dark-vowelled birds.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death.I hear him leading his horse out of the stall; I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.But I will not hold the bridlewhile he clinches the girth.And he may mount by himself: I will not give him a leg up. Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,I will not tell him which way the fox ran.With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where the black boy hides in the swamp.I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;I am not on his pay-roll. I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends nor of my enemies either.Though he promise me much, I will not map him the route to any man's door.Am I a spy in the land of the living,that I should deliver men to Death?Brother, the password and the plans of our city are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe love of field and coppice Of green and shaded lanes, Of ordered woods and gardens Is running in your veins. Strong love of grey-blue distance, Brown streams and soft, dim skies I know, but cannot share it, My love is otherwise. I love a sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, Of droughts and flooding rains. I love her far horizons, I love her jewel-sea, Her beauty and her terror The wide brown land for me! The stark white ring-barked forests, All tragic to the moon, The sapphire-misted mountains, The hot gold hush of noon, Green tangle of the brushes Where lithe lianas coil, And orchids deck the tree-tops, And ferns the warm dark soil. Core of my heart, my country! Her pitiless blue sky, When, sick at heart, around us We see the cattle die But then the grey clouds gather, And we can bless again The drumming of an army, The steady soaking rain. Core of my heart, my country! Land of the rainbow gold, For flood and fire and famine She pays us back threefold. Over the thirsty paddocks, Watch, after many days, The filmy veil of greenness That thickens as we gaze ... An opal-hearted country, A wilful, lavish land All you who have not loved her, You will not understand though Earth holds many splendours, Wherever I may die, I know to what brown country My homing thoughts will fly. **\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBe glad your nose is on your face,not pasted on some other place,for if it were where it is not,you might dislike your nose a lot.Imagine if your precious nosewere sandwiched in between your toes,that clearly would not be a treat,for you'd be forced to smell your feet.Your nose would be a source of dreadwere it attached atop your head,it soon would drive you to despair,forever tickled by your hair.Within your ear, your nose would bean absolute catastrophe,for when you were obliged to sneeze,your brain would rattle from the breeze.Your nose, instead, through thick and thin,remains between your eyes and chin,not pasted on some other place--be glad your nose is on your face!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tConsidera girl who keeps slipping off, arms limp as old carrots, into the hypnotist's trance, into a spirit worldspeaking with the gift of tongues.She is stuck in the time machine, suddenly two years old sucking her thumb, as inward as a snail, learning to talk again.She's on a voyage.She is swimming further and further back, up like a salmon, struggling into her mother's pocketbook.Little doll child, come here to Papa.Sit on my knee.I have kisses for the back of your neck.A penny for your thoughts, Princess.I will hunt them like an emerald.Come be my snookyand I will give you a root.That kind of voyage, rank as a honeysuckle.Oncea king had a christeningfor his daughter Briar Roseand because he had only twelve gold plateshe asked only twelve fairiesto the grand event.The thirteenth fairy, her fingers as long and thing as straws, her eyes burnt by cigarettes, her uterus an empty teacup, arrived with an evil gift.She made this prophecy: The princess shall prick herselfon a spinning wheel in her fifteenth yearand then fall down dead.Kaputt! The court fell silent.The king looked like Munch's ScreamFairies' prophecies, in times like those, held water.However the twelfth fairyhad a certain kind of eraserand thus she mitigated the cursechanging that deathinto a hundred-year sleep.The king ordered every spinning wheelexterminated and exorcised.Briar Rose grew to be a goddessand each night the kingbit the hem of her gownto keep her safe.He fastened the moon upwith a safety pinto give her perpetual lightHe forced every male in the courtto scour his tongue with Bab-olest they poison the air she dwelt in.Thus she dwelt in his odor.Rank as honeysuckle.On her fifteenth birthdayshe pricked her fingeron a charred spinning wheeland the clocks stopped.Yes indeed. She went to sleep.The king and queen went to sleep, the courtiers, the flies on the wall.The fire in the hearth grew stilland the roast meat stopped crackling.The trees turned into metaland the dog became china.They all lay in a trance, each a catatonicstuck in a time machine.Even the frogs were zombies.Only a bunch of briar roses grewforming a great wall of tacksaround the castle.Many princestried to get through the bramblesfor they had heard much of Briar Rosebut they had not scoured their tonguesso they were held by the thornsand thus were crucified.In due timea hundred years passedand a prince got through.The briars parted as if for Mosesand the prince found the tableau intact.He kissed Briar Roseand she woke up crying: Daddy! Daddy! Presto! She's out of prison! She married the princeand all went wellexcept for the fear -the fear of sleep.Briar Rosewas an insomniac...She could not napor lie in sleepwithout the court chemistmixing her some knock-out dropsand never in the prince's presence.If if is to come, she said, sleep must take me unawareswhile I am laughing or dancingso that I do not know that brutal placewhere I lie down with cattle prods, the hole in my cheek open.Further, I must not dreamfor when I do I see the table setand a faltering crone at my place, her eyes burnt by cigarettesas she eats betrayal like a slice of meat.I must not sleepfor while I'm asleep I'm ninetyand think I'm dying.Death rattles in my throatlike a marble.I wear tubes like earrings.I lie as still as a bar of iron.You can stick a needlethrough my kneecap and I won't flinch.I'm all shot up with Novocain.This trance girlis yours to do with.You could lay her in a grave, an awful package, and shovel dirt on her faceand she'd never call back: Hello there! But if you kissed her on the mouthher eyes would spring openand she'd call out: Daddy! Daddy! Presto! She's out of prison.There was a theft.That much I am told.I was abandoned.That much I know.I was forced backward.I was forced forward.I was passed hand to handlike a bowl of fruit.Each night I am nailed into placeand forget who I am.Daddy? That's another kind of prison.It's not the prince at all, but my fatherdrunkeningly bends over my bed, circling the abyss like a shark, my father thick upon melike some sleeping jellyfish.What voyage is this, little girl?

Why did he shoot them.I didn't know where I was going with this.They were on his property, I said.When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room.Today I traded hellos with my neighbor.Our voices hung close in the new acoustics.A room with the walls blasted to shreds and falling.We returned to our shoveling, working side by side in silence.But why were they on his property, he asked.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIt was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness Were in each of them. Even the crows were so Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in Attics and the urine of lizards and mice....

''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door-                Only this, and nothing more.'    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.    Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow    From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-                Nameless here for evermore.    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,    ''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-                This it is, and nothing more.'    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  'Sir,' said I, 'or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you'- here I opened wide the door;-                Darkness there, and nothing more.    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,        fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, 'Lenore!'  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, 'Lenore!'-                Merely this, and nothing more.    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,   Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.    'Surely,' said I, 'surely that is something at my window lattice:    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-  Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-                'Tis the wind and nothing more.'    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and        flutter,  In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed        he;    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-                Perched, and sat, and nothing more.   Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.   'Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' I said, 'art sure no        craven,   Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being    Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                With such name as 'Nevermore.'    But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.    Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-    Till I scarcely more than muttered, 'other friends have flown        before-  On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'                Then the bird said, 'Nevermore.'     Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  'Doubtless,' said I, 'what it utters is its only stock and store,     Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster     Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-  Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                Of 'Never- nevermore'.'    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and        door;    Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                Meant in croaking 'Nevermore.'    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining    On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,                She shall press, ah, nevermore!    Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.    'Wretch,' I cried, 'thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he        hath sent thee    Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or        devil!-  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-    On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-  Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    'Prophet!' said I, 'thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or        devil!  By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.'                Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    'Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,' I shrieked,        upstarting-  'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!

Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my        door!'               Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,    And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the        floor;  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                Shall be lifted- nevermore!\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBirds {10 short poems} Oh, you little birds; Happy to see you in your nest, so pretty, so nice clinging to your mother’s breast Wish my castle Be like your nest where God always rests Wish to speak to you In softest words, don’t shy away As it pains me all the way In a day, you will fly away Sweet birds, up in the sky a happy fly Not known to me your way Only your songs Treasured in my memory will Chase you wherever you go and stay Clear and blue is the sky Grasses green and trees in leafage anew You seem happy singing all day through Such is the power of your Liquid notes melting down darkness Into dawn to greet the day-king at morn Carry live orchestra on wings Deliver priceless melodies at will, so tender And serene that attract all to your ring Always happy, through field And forest you fly to where you care Trilling your gratefulness to earth and sky you share Oh, birds, tell me your secrets Of happiness that I long for ever Or carry me on your wings to Heaven Where happiness flows ever and ever.......\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOut of the church she followed them  With a lofty step and mien: His bride was like a village maid,   Maude Clare was like a queen.“Son Thomas, ” his lady mother said,   With smiles, almost with tears: “May Nell and you but live as true  As we have done for years; “Your father thirty years ago    Had just your tale to tell; But he was not so pale as you,   Nor I so pale as Nell.”My lord was pale with inward strife,   And Nell was pale with pride; My lord gazed long on pale Maude Clare  Or ever he kissed the bride.“Lo, I have brought my gift, my lord,     Have brought my gift, ” she said: To bless the hearth, to bless the board,    To bless the marriage-bed.“Here’s my half of the golden chain  You wore about your neck, That day we waded ankle-deep  For lilies in the beck: “Here’s my half of the faded leaves    We plucked from the budding bough, With feet amongst the lily leaves, -  The lilies are budding now.”He strove to match her scorn with scorn,   He faltered in his place: “Lady, ” he said, - “Maude Clare, ” he said, -  “Maude Clare, ” – and hid his face.She turn’d to Nell: “My Lady Nell,   I have a gift for you; Though, were it fruit, the blooms were gone,   Or, were it flowers, the dew.“Take my share of a fickle heart,     Mine of a paltry love: Take it or leave it as you will,     I wash my hands thereof.”“And what you leave, ” said Nell, “I’ll take,     And what you spurn, I’ll wear; For he’s my lord for better and worse,    And him I love Maude Clare.“Yea, though you’re taller by the head,   More wise and much more fair: I’ll love him till he loves me best,   Me best of all Maude Clare.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tHe is that fallen lance that lies as hurled, That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust, But still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust. If we who sight along it round the world, See nothing worthy to have been its mark, It is because like men we look too near, Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere, Our missiles always make too short an arc. They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect The curve of earth, and striking, break their own; They make us cringe for metal-point on stone. But this we know, the obstacle that checked And tripped the body, shot the spirit on Further than target ever showed or shone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTo drive Paul out of any lumber campAll that was needed was to say to him,'How is the wife, Paul?'- and he'd disappear.Some said it was because be bad no wife,And hated to be twitted on the subject;Others because he'd come within a dayOr so of having one, and then been Jilted;Others because he'd had one once, a good one,Who'd run away with someone else and left him;And others still because he had one nowHe only had to be reminded of- He was all duty to her in a minute:He had to run right off to look her up,As if to say, 'That's so, how is my wife?I hope she isn't getting into mischief.'No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.He'd been the hero of the mountain campsEver since, just to show them, he bad slippedThe bark of a whole tamarack off wholeAs clean as boys do off a willow twigTo make a willow whistle on a SundayApril by subsiding meadow brooks.They seemed to ask him just to see him go,'How is the wife, Paul?' and he always went.He never stopped to murder anyoneWho asked the question. He just disappeared- Nobody knew in what direction,Although it wasn't usually longBefore they beard of him in some new camp,The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.The question everywhere was why should PaulObject to being asked a civil question- A man you could say almost anything toShort of a fighting word. You have the answers.And there was one more not so fair to Paul:That Paul had married a wife not his equal.Paul was ashamed of her. To match a heroShe would have had to be a heroine;Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.But if the story Murphy told was true,She wasn't anything to be ashamed of.You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone'sHeard how he thrashed the horses on a loadThat wouldn't budge, until they simply stretchedTheir rawhide harness from the load to camp.Paul told the boss the load would be all right,'The sun will bring your load in'- and it did- By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.That's what is called a stretcher. But I guessThe one about his jumping so's to landWith both his feet at once against the ceiling,And then land safely right side up again,Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact.Well, this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wifeOut of a white-pine log. Murphy was thereAnd, as you might say, saw the lady born.Paul worked at anything in lumbering.He'd been bard at it taking boards awayFor- I forget- the last ambitious sawyerTo want to find out if he couldn't pileThe lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.They'd sliced the first slab off a big butt log,And the sawyer had slammed the carriage backTo slam end-on again against the saw teeth.To judge them by the way they caught themselvesWhen they saw what had happened to the log,They must have had a guilty expectationSomething was going to go with their slambanging.Something bad left a broad black streak of greaseOn the new wood the whole length of the logExcept, perhaps, a foot at either end.But when Paul put his finger in the grease,It wasn't grease at all, but a long slot.The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.'First time I ever saw a hollow pine.That comes of having Paul around the place.Take it to bell for me,' the sawyer said.Everyone had to have a look at itAnd tell Paul what he ought to do about it.(They treated it as his.) 'You take a jackknife,And spread the opening, and you've got a dugoutAll dug to go a-fishing in.' To PaulThe hollow looked too sound and clean and emptyEver to have housed birds or beasts or bees.There was no entrance for them to get in by.It looked to him like some new kind of hollowHe thought he'd better take his jackknife to.So after work that evening be came backAnd let enough light into it by cuttingTo see if it was empty. He made out in thereA slender length of pith, or was it pith?It might have been the skin a snake had castAnd left stood up on end inside the treeThe hundred years the tree must have been growing.More cutting and he bad this in both hands,And looking from it to the pond nearby,Paul wondered how it would respond to water.Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of airHe made in walking slowly to the beachBlew it once off his hands and almost broke it.He laid it at the edge, where it could drink.At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.At the next drink it grew invisible.Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,And thought it must have melted. It was gone.And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom,It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,Who, leaning on a log, looked back at Paul.And that made Paul in turn look backTo see if it was anyone behind himThat she was looking at instead of him.(Murphy had been there watching all the time,But from a shed where neither of them could see him.)There was a moment of suspense in birthWhen the girl seemed too waterlogged to live,Before she caught her first breath with a gaspAnd laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,And walked off, talking to herself or Paul,Across the logs like backs of alligators,Paul taking after her around the pond.Next evening Murphy and some other fellowsGot drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,From the bare top of which there is a viewTO other hills across a kettle valley.And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.It was the only glimpse that anyoneHas had of Paul and her since Murphy saw themFalling in love across the twilight millpond.More than a mile across the wildernessThey sat together halfway up a cliffIn a small niche let into it, the girlBrightly, as if a star played on the place,Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the lightWas from the girl herself, though, not from a star,As was apparent from what happened next.All those great ruffians put their throats together,And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.Of course the bottle fell short by a mile,But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.She went out like a firefly, and that was all.So there were witnesses that Paul was marriedAnd not to anyone to be ashamed ofEveryone had been wrong in judging Paul.Murphy told me Paul put on all those airsAbout his wife to keep her to himself.Paul was what's called a terrible possessor.Owning a wife with him meant owning her.She wasn't anybody else's business,Either to praise her or much as name her,And he'd thank people not to think of her.Murphy's idea was that a man like PaulWouldn't be spoken to about a wifeIn any way the world knew how to speak.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tI do not think of you lying in the wet clayOf a Monaghan graveyard; I seeYou walking down a lane among the poplarsOn your way to the station, or happilyGoing to second Mass on a summer Sunday -You meet me and you say:'Don't forget to see about the cattle - 'Among your earthiest words the angels stray.And I think of you walking along a headlandOf green oats in June,So full of repose, so rich with life -And I see us meeting at the end of a townOn a fair day by accident, afterThe bargains are all made and we can walkTogether through the shops and stalls and marketsFree in the oriental streets of thought.O you are not lying in the wet clay,For it is a harvest evening now and weAre piling up the ricks against the moonlightAnd you smile up at us - eternally.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChaos ruled OK in the classroomas bravely the teacher walked inthe nooligans ignored himhis voice was lost in the din'The theme for today is violenceand homework will be setI'm going to teach you a lessonone that you'll never forget'He picked on a boy who was shoutingand throttled him then and therethen garrotted the girl behind him(the one with grotty hair) Then sword in hand he hacked his waybetween the chattering rows'First come, first severed' he declared'fingers, feet or toes'He threw the sword at a latecomerit struck with deadly aimthen pulling out a shotgunhe continued with his gameThe first blast cleared the backrow(where those who skive hang out) they collapsed like rubber dinghieswhen the plug's pulled out'Please may I leave the room sir?

Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,Whether the summer clothe the general earthWith greenness, or the redbreast sit and singBetwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branchOf mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatchSmokes in the sun-thaw ; whether the eave-drops fallHeard only in the trances of the blast,Or if the secret ministry of frostShall hang them up in silent icicles,     Quietly shining to the quiet Moon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf I can stop one heart from breaking,I shall not live in vain;If I can ease one life the aching,Or cool one pain,Or help one fainting robinUnto his nest again,I shall not live in vain.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAutumn moonlight--  a worm digs silently    into the chestnut.Translated by Robert Hass\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAll the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances,And one man in his time plays many parts,His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchelAnd shining morning face, creeping like snailUnwillingly to school. And then the lover,Sighing like furnace, with a woeful balladMade to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,Seeking the bubble reputationEven in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,In fair round belly with good capon lined,With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,Full of wise saws and modern instances;And so he plays his part. The sixth age shiftsInto the lean and slippered pantaloon,With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wideFor his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,Turning again toward childish treble, pipesAnd whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,That ends this strange eventful history,Is second childishness and mere oblivion,Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(With compliments

employment by the authors of simile andmetaphor.Authors of all races, be they Greeks, Romans, Teutons or Celts,Can't seem just to say that anything is the thing it is but have togo out of their way to say that it is like something else.What does it mean when we are toldThat that Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold?In the first place, George Gordon Byron had enough experienceTo know that it probably wasn't just one Assyrian, it was a lot ofAssyrians.However, as too many arguments are apt to induce apoplexy andthus hinder longevity.We'll let it pass as one Assyrian for the sake of brevity.Now then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts weregleaming in purple and gold,Just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like awold on the fold?In heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophythere are great many things.But I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purpleand gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings.No, no, Lord Byron, before I'll believe that this Assyrian wasactually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof;Did he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big redmouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?Frankly I think it is very unlikely, and all you were entitled to say,at the very most,Was that the Assyrian cohorts came down like a lot of Assyriancohorts about to destroy the Hebrew host.But that wasn't fancy enough for Lord Byron, oh dear me no, hehad to invent a lot of figures of speech and then interpolate them,With the result that whenever you mention Old Testament soldiersto people they say Oh yes, they're the ones that a lot ofwolves dressed up in gold and purple ate them.That's the kind of thing that's being done all the time by poets,from Homer to Tennyson;They're always comparing ladies to lilies and veal to venison,And they always say things like that the snow is a white blanketafter a winter storm.Oh it is, is it, all right then, you sleep under a six-inch blanket ofsnow and I'll sleep under a half-inch blanket of unpoeticalblanket material and we'll see which one keeps warm,And after that maybe you'll begin to comprehend dimlyWhat I mean by too much metaphor and simile.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom fabrication springs the spiral stairup which the wakeful princess climbs to findthe source of blanching light that conjured herto leave her bed of fever and ascenda visionary ladder toward the moonwhose holy blue anoints her injured hand.With finger bandaged where the waspish pinflew from the intricate embroideryand stung according to the witch's plan,she mounts through malice of the needle's eye,trailing her scrupulously simple gownalong bright asterisks by milky way.Colonnades of angels nod her inwhere ancient, infinite, and beautiful,her legendary godmother leans down,spinning a single stubborn thread of woolwhich all the artful wizards cannot crimpto keep the young girl from her crowning goal.Initiated by the lunar lamp,kindling her within a steepled flame,the princess hears the thunder and the pompof squadrons underground abducting himwho is the destination of the cordnow bound around her wrist till she redeemthis miner's boy from goblin bodyguard.Guided only by the tug and twitchof that mercurial strand, the girl goes downthe darkening stair, undoes the palace latchand slips unseen past watchmen on the lawndozing around their silvered sentry box.Across the frosted grass she marks the sheenof thread conducting her to the worn tracksmade by miners up the mountainsideamong the jagged mazes of the rocks.Laboring on the tilt of that steep gradebehind which the declining moon has set,she recalls queer stories her nurse readabout a goblin raid on miner's hutbecause new excavations came too nearthe chambers where their fiendish queen would sit.Hearing a weird cackle from afar,she clutches at the talismanic cordand confronts a cairn of iron ore.Suddenly a brazen song is heardfrom the pragmatic boy confined within,gaily cursing the whole goblin horde.Inviolate in the circle of that skein,looping like faith about her bleeding feet,the princess frees the miner, stone by stone,and leads him home to be her chosen knight.The princess coaxes the incredulous boythrough candid kitchens in the rising sunto seek the staircase by the glare of day.Hand in hand, they scale meridian,clambering up the creaking heights of heatuntil she hears the twittering machinewhich quaintly wove the fabric of her fatebehind the zodiac on attic doorwith abracadabra from the alphabet.Pointing toward the spindle's cryptic whir,she tells the greenhorn miner to bow downand honor the great goddess of the airsuspended aloft within her planet-shine.Laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demandswhy he should kneel before a silly scenewhere pigeons promenade the gable-endsand coo quadrilles about the blighted corein a batch of raveled apple rinds.At his words, the indignant godmothervanishes in a labyrinth of haywhile sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor.O never again will the extravagant strawknit up a gilded fable for the childwho weeps before the desolate tableauof clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWay Down South in Dixie(Break the heart of me)They hung my black young loverTo a cross roads tree.Way Down South in Dixie(Bruised body high in air)I asked the white Lord JesusWhat was the use of prayer.Way Down South in Dixie(Break the heart of me)Love is a naked shadowOn a gnarled and naked tree.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWho wants my jellyfish?I'm

sink again; Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath, Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone; Yet many a man is making friends with death Even as I speak, for lack of love alone. It well may be that in a difficult hour, Pinned down by pain and moaning for release, Or nagged by want past resolution's power, I might be driven to sell your love for peace, Or trade the memory of this night for food. It well may be. I do not think I would.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t     When I have fears that I may cease to be          Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,     Before high-piled books, in charactery,         Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;     When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,         Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,     And think that I may never live to trace         Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;     And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,         That I shall never look upon thee more,     Never have relish in the faery power         Of unreflecting love;--then on the shore     Of the wide world I stand alone, and think     Till love and fame to nothingness do sink.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCurtains forcing their will   against the wind,children sleep,exchanging dreams with   seraphim.
